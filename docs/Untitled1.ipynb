      "This movie was just horrendous. How could anybody like this movie  and for the ones who liked it because of the jokes  they should really take a long hard look in the mirror and ask themselves if stereotypes are not bad. Ignoring the face of the racial stereotypes  this was just awful. It never had its moments  if it paid homage to 1980's  Airplane!  it needs to pay some more. Awful acting  terrible script writing  even for a movie with Mo'Nique or Tom Arnold. This movie was bad from the beginning  but people might have seen the whole thing  by the thought that the plane would crash. One of the worse movies ever  stay away.\n",

      "Not as bad as Billy Bathgate but close. Try as he might  Warren Beatty just could not be believed as Bugsy. Whenever he flipped out  instead of being shocked by the violence  I found it pretty embarrassing because it was so phony. The other actors don't fare as well either. Annette Bening just doesn't have what it takes to play seductive women  she is better off with safe characters. As many have noted  Joe Mantegna would have fared better if the script had him as a more believable George Raft. Only Harvey Keitel emerged unscathed  but then again this guy can do these movies in his sleep. And Robert Beltran  with just one line  steals one of the big Beatty  Bening scenes. With these films  I'm never sure if the director is intent on making the mobsters seem like normal businessmen or if it just comes out that way. Either way  I don't like it. These guys were killers and no matter how much Las Vegas is indebted to Bugsy Siegel  I don't think that a movie should be made glorifying the guy  especially one with a big studio backing.\n",

Alien Factor is actually rather imaginative considering the low budget and it's fairly creepy  but Nightbeast  which I guess is sort of an updating of Alien Factor  is just plain dumb. Actors sleepwalk through their roles  especially Mr. Monotone sheriff  and the monster is some dumb Halloween-mask kind of thing instead of the wildly imaginative (but kind of stupid) looking critters from Alien Factor. A spaceship crashes on Earth and there's a critter inside  of course  who runs around vaporizing people. And ripping off arms  etc. And he has a cool ray gun that he uses to vaporize people too  until it gets shot out of his hand. And that's really about it. Alien Factor beats this mess hands down  if you really want to see a good Don Dohler movie  check that out instead. And RIP Don Dohler  12/2/06.\n",

      "Even die hard John Wayne fans will have to concede that this film is a mess. Wayne's character  John Tobin is after the gang that killed his parents  led by half Apache  half white renegade Pandro Zanti (Earl Dwire)  posing as a Mexican.   There are almost too many silly plot points to count  but those that stand out include Sheriff Williams (Jack Rockwell) cuffing a captured Zanti around his boot  so all Zanti has to do to get free is remove his boot! Tobin's friend Dusty (George pre-Gabby Hayes) takes a thrown knife in the back  and comes back good as new for the rest of the story. In a chase scene  Tobin rides a makeshift log flume through a drainage trough surrounded by log walls in the middle of a desert  and missing his mark  chases (actually walks after) Zanti on foot through the desert. Zanti seeks relief and drinks from a pool of water  but OOPS!  he didn't see the sign above the waterhole that states Don't Drink Poison. As Zanti collapses dead  Tobin resumes his chase after the remainder of the gang  and captures the whole lot by blowing up a rock wall that seals a secret passage into Dusty's cabin - how convenient.  In the closing scene  the new Sheriff Tobin is seen on the phone talking to the new Mrs. Tobin (Sheila Terry)  Dusty's daughter Ruby  who earlier in the film was a kidnap target of Zanti's gang. Apparently  the studio was intent on Wayne's getting the girl in virtually every film they made with him  as this type of ending is completely predictable for almost all of Lone Star's films.\n",

If watching a poorly-acted  suspenseless  snoozer of a movie about Sloth from the Goonies kill people in a fashion that completely ignores every law of physics (pulling on an unrestrained person's legs  causing them to be ripped from the torso) is your idea of a good movie  then knock yourself out.

Three couples decide it might be a good idea to check out a nearly-abandoned ghost town  in hopes of finding the gold that people were killed over a scant century-and-a-half before. You'd think that with a title like Miner's Massacre some interesting things might happen. They don't. In fact  only about 1/10 of the film actually takes place in the mine. I had envisioned teams of terrified miners scampering for their lives in the cavernous confines of their workplace  praying that Black Lung Disease would get them before The Grim Reaper exacted his grisly revenge  but instead I got terrestrial twenty-somethings fornicating--and  in one case  defecating--in the woods  a gang of morons with a collective I.Q. that would have difficulty pulling a plastic ring out of a box of Cracker Jacks  much less a buried treasure from an abandoned mine.

      "The first film I saw from these people was Children of the Grave and when I heard that this one was coming on I thought it would be good to watch mostly because Waverly is a real place that is rumored to be haunted. This documentary/film was AWFUL! There was too much fake commentary from the producers  directors  camera men...they needed to keep their faces out of this film. Waverly has been rumored to be haunted for a long time yet if anyone in doubt about it watches this film they will no doubt start to believe that every story about the place is as fake as this documentary. The paranormal proof was horrible and almost non-existent. I have heard better EVPs from high school students with tape recorders in a bathroom! They tried too hard to make things scary and the end result was that nothing was scary. Not the stories  not the blurry too dark to see anything videos  not the pictures  not the tape recordings! Children of the Grave was bad as well but at least it had some substance and a little bit of a creep factor. The only reason I am giving this a 3 is because the history portion of the show was very good and informative. Learning about how the hospital came about  the daily life there and how it ended was the only thing worth while in this 2hr piece of crap.\n",

      "Like CURSE OF THE KOMODO was for the creature feature genre  Jim Wynorski's CHEERLEADER MASSACRE is a straight-faced parody of slasher movies  such as SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE. A psycho  who has escaped from his padded cell (..he was sent to the loony bin thanks to killing eleven people)is working across the mountainous backwoods countryside of Bobcat County attacking anyone within his reach. A van load of cheerleaders  their teacher  two equipment hands  and the driver are on their way to a contest when their vehicle runs out of fuel while taking a supposed short-cut to avoid having to turn back. Luckily the group find a cabin up ahead  but fall prey to a killer who attacks each victim one by one. The psycho loose in the county couldn't have killed one girl because she was in the cheerleaders' locker room while he was elsewhere which means someone among their own is the culprit. Meanwhile the sheriff of the county and his deputy pursue the whereabouts of their psycho  while also trying to find the location of the missing cheerleader squad.  Shot cheap on video  Wynorski does what he can with the limited budget having to find clever ways to assassinate characters off-screen without the luxury of properly effective special effects. In other words  lots of melons were stabbed  the sound effect used to let us know that certain victims whisked away into the darkness by a black gloved hand died savagely. Wynorski incorporates a scene from SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE regarding Brinke Stevens' character Linda  her being pursued by a killer with a drill(..that killer and Linda both wound up dead  but I guess Wynorski wanted to connect his film to that one  albeit rather poorly)..still it was nice to see her  even if it was a glorified cameo. Tamie Sheffield  as Ms Hendricks the teacher of the students in trouble  has a long bathing scene in the shower soaping her naked body and fake breasts. The girls who make up the cheerleaders are a bit unconvincing  because their obviously in their twenties. Aging soft-core porn stars Samantha Philips(..as a police officer who is attacked by the psychopath she's searching for)and Nikki Fritz(..a hiker who is victimized while jogging across a dangerous bridge)surprisingly don't have to strip. Wynorski vets Bill Langlois Monroe(..as Sheriff Murdock) and Melissa Brasselle(..as a detective who assists Murdock on his case)contribute to the sub-plot of the search for John Colton's serial killer McPherson. Interesting enough  the McPherson story serves as a McGuffan as  in truth  the meat of the film is devoted to the cheerleading group and their perilous situation. I'm not sure if slasher fans will embrace this movie because it takes too long for the kills to flare up and when they eventually enter the picture  the violence isn't potent or shocking enough to satisfy.\n",

      "*****I reveal two 'twists' at the end of the film. Do not read if you want to watch this movie for some reason*****  Oh my  this is bad. And for some reason  Sean Bean  one of the greatest present day actors  has sold his soul and appears in it. The only consolation is that the scriptwriters must have realised that someone as ultimately pathetic as Steve Guttenberg could never in his life aspire to kill someone as cool as Sean Bean. Instead  he is killed in what must have seemed like a marvellous twist at the end  by the good guy who was meant to be be killed by Bean  but was actually his boss and faked his own death. Don't worry. I haven't ruined anything for you. The acting itself is spectacularly apalling  with Guttenberg's patented Hey-look-I-can-pull-a-Chuck-Norris-face hard man stare dominating most of the two hours of hell on earth. Added to a plot that I could have written whilst being tortured and hung upside down with both hands cut off  there is also a completely nonsensical critical error in the fact that one moment the virus will escape if they so much as look at it wrong  while another moment  Steve Guttenberg is bravely running around with it  throwing  catching bashing and generally abusing this 'virus' which has the distinct look of a collection of those little balls of soap you put in your bath. My final word? If you are suicidally depressed and feel like you want to laugh manically at something that should be a bad comedy but even worse isn't  tape it next time it's on channel 5 at midnight  then burn it when you realise that I am indeed telling the truth.\n",

Then again maybe I read the summary for the other movie called Mausolem instead as there were two movies of this title released about the same time with both featuring plots that had key elements in common. However  reading stuff about that movie here I know I saw this one and not that one and that movie is even less what one would imagine a movie with that title would be about. I will be honest  I expect more of a zombie type picture and you get that in this movie to some degree. However  there is more stuff involving the occult and strange powers as the opening scene of the people being taken away by the coroner at the beginning of the film will attest to. The movie also has the old theme of kids going somewhere they do not belong to have some crazy party  in this case it is in fact a mausoleum. The other movie I do not think really has that key feature playing that prominent role in the movie and I see the score for this one is higher too  still it was just not the movie I was expecting.\n",

She receives another low grade from Tingle  which doesn't help. When one of her classmates Luke steals the paper of the final history exams and pops it in her bag  Mrs. Tingle finds it sticking out. She threatens the three that she will go to the principal about it  but he's not available. So before she reports it the next morning. Leigh  her friend Jo Lynn and Scott head to her place that night and try to convince her not tell the principal. However due to Tingle's stubbornness  that find themselves reverting to drastic measures to stop this getting out.  Wasn't fan of it when I first saw it  and after another viewing  I'm still not one. Writer Kevin Williamson was on a roll after penning the successful contemporary teen horror films; 'Scream (1996)'  'I Know What You did Last Summer (1997)'  'Scream 2 (1997)' and 'The Faculty (1998)'. He was riding the success (also not to forget the TV show 'Dawson's Creek)  but this project would be the final bump. The difference there  compared with this entry was other then writing the screenplay  he was also making his debut in directing. The strange thing though  was that I found his direction to be competently done  but material he stormed up to flavourless and tired. It seemed to get caught in playing both a black comedy and straight-out thriller  without making it gel. The script is cluttered with quick-wit  on-going gags  trivial stretches and gimmicky references towards other films  but the problem is that it's too watered-down with so many contrived developments and sappy moral currents disrupting the flow. The fractured script had to be more strong and potent  since it's a small-scale production that feels like you're watching a stage show because of its mostly confined sets. It tries to play mind games with the characters  but these moments are there to only serve the story's poor progression into a puddle of stupidity and senselessness. The film's ending takes the cake. Williamson's polished direction is sound  but more so in a pedestrian way and therefore it lacks suspense and the pacing even with its taut surroundings can really plod on. You eventually feel it after the halfway mark  and it shows up how minor the story is. The performances are tolerable enough  although if it weren't for Helen Mirren's classy  icy portrayal of manipulative prowess as Mrs. Tingle and a buoyant Marisa Coughlan  we would have been stuck watching a vapid goody-to-shoes Katie Holmes. Barry Watson is modest in his slacker part and Molly Ringwald has a lesser role. The soundtrack packs enough energy  but I found it terribly overwrought and shapeless in its choices.  Watchable  but mechanical all round.\n",

      "So  you've seen the Romero movies  yes? And you've seen Jacob's Ladder  right? And the later Hellraiser movies? Okay  now let's make a movie out of all three  only let's just jam everything together and make a whole big mess of it  sounds like a good idea?  This movie is terrible. Absolutely god-awful. Yeah  it's an indie flick  who gives a crap? Is that a pass to make filmic excrement? The film attempts to establish credibility by focusing on character interaction  that much is evident. Unfortunately for the writers  they're not good at character interaction. This isn't Night of the Living Dead; the characters are nonentities shouting their inane lines at each other in a vain attempt to be caught by the microphones on set. The dialogue is never interesting. For a movie that focuses so much on character interaction  you'd think the characters would have something more to say than WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO I don't know WELL WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING Well what are we going to do? I DON'T KNOW. We should leave. LET'S JUST ACCEPT OUR FATE. No  we've got to leave. WELL LET'S LEAVE THEN. No  maybe we should stay.  This isn't exaggeration  there are exchanges in this film that reach that level of redundancy and inanity.  The worst thing about this movie? Half of it is a dream  and it really has zero purpose. Nothing in the dream has any relevance to anything in the rest of the movie. The writers couldn't decide whether to make a zombie movie or a monster movie and so they just made both. It's patently ridiculous  the cheapest trick in the book  and it's maddeningly insulting  especially since I'm pretty sure they ripped off the idea from Jacob's ladder  which handled the concept a hell of a lot more competently than these jokers could ever hope to do.  And then there's the editing. Years of watching MTV and playing horror-themed video games must have inspired the filmmakers  but it's surely a sad thing they didn't realize what made the choppy editing and obfuscation in those pieces of media effective in the first place. In this film  you will be confused often  and not in the good  David Lynch way  but in the bad Wait I thought she just got killed  no? Then who the hell was that? Wait  who is that guy? Where did he come from? How did they get here? kind of way. It's constant and consistently bad.  This movie is a laughable piece of trash and should only be sought out if you want to get trashed with a few friends and laugh at it.  And as a final note: as for the comedy people in other reviews are talking about  it's all unintentional. There isn't a single intentional piece of comedy in this film. It's all supposed to be a big serious character study  because the filmmakers want to have credibility in their horror-concept. Sadly  their pretensions don't match up to their ability.\n",

A very talented cast and good dialogue.Then it all fell apart for me at the sight of the first vampire. I couldn't believe my eyes.A great thriller was flushed down the toilet.

      "A remake of a successful movie can be a tricky business at best; to remake a true classic  especially one that is veritably the definitive film of a director like Alfred Hitchcock  is something else again. And after watching this version of `Psycho ' directed by Gus Van Sant  two things come to mind immediately: What's the point  and what on earth were they thinking? Especially in light of the fact that Van Sant used the same screenplay (by Joseph Stefano  taken from the novel by Robert Bloch) that Hitchcock used. The final result here underscores some of the finer points of the art of filmmaking: First  that a `remake' should be just that; a retooling of the original  rather than a `copy' using new players; and second  that shooting in color  using more blood and being a bit more graphic does little more than detract from the impact of the film. Although this was a noble effort by Van Sant  ironically in the end it suffers from the same flaw with which Norma Bates was afflicted: The `mind' of the film was divided; half was Hitchcock  half Van Sant. And the twain  though met  shall never be bound. Van Sant  even working from the original script  would have been better off making his own film-- all the way through-- rather than attempting to duplicate exactly what Hitchcock did with certain scenes. The opening shot of the movie  for instance  and especially the `shower' scene  arguably one of the most famous scenes in the history of the cinema. Copying Hitchcock  from the shots looking directly into the shower head to the one of the drain  and using the same `skree! skree! skree!' sound effects-- even as homage to Hitchcock-- again  only distracted from the story. And  if you factor in the performance of William H. Macy (as Private Eye Arbogast)  you have yet another split in the psyche of the film. Macy is a terrific actor-- one of the best character actors in the business-- and his performance here is excellent; but as good as it is  the attitude and delivery are pure David Mamet (with whom he has worked many times)  and seemingly out of context with what Van Sant is doing. So the film winds up with a triple personality disorder: Hitchcock  Van Sant and Mamet. I felt like I was watching `House Of Good Will Psycho Games.'   \tAs far as performances go  Macy's was as solid as they come  and Anne Heche (Marion Crane) did a good job of creating an original character  escaping the trap of attempting an imitation of Janet Leigh. The weak links were Viggo Mortensen (Sam)  who made Marion's boyfriend so smarmy and unappealing it made you wonder why she had anything to do with him in the first place; and Vince Vaughn  who--to put it as delicately as possible-- was simply awful as Norman Bates. His whole performance was that of an actor playing a role (and not very convincingly at that); affecting effeminate mannerisms and punctuating his speech with `spontaneous' bursts of maniacal laughter made his Norman more of a caricature than a character  altogether unbelievable and pretentious. It gave the movie the feel of a reenactment of a `True Incident' you would see on a television show; it would have been entirely in keeping with the sensibility of the film to cut away from Norman sitting alone in his parlor to a shot of a sober-faced Peter Graves  intoning  `Such was the mind-set of Norman Bates on that fateful  rainy night when Marion Crane stepped out of her car and into his life--' The supporting cast includes Julianne Moore (Lila)  Robert Forster (Dr. Simon)  Philip Baker Hall (Sheriff Al Chambers)  Anne Haney (Mrs. Chambers)  Chad Everett (Tom Cassidy)  Rance Howard (Mr. Lowery)  Rita Wilson (Caroline)  James Remar (Patrolman) and James LeGros (Charlie the Car Dealer). If nothing else  Van Sant's `Psycho' is a curiosity that goes to show that having a good director  a predominantly excellent cast and a script that is a proven commodity does not necessarily insure a success. Granted  todays era of psycho-babble  `American Psycho' and Hannibal Lecter have effectively taken the edge off of a character like Norman Bates somewhat; but there is still a singular intimacy in this particular story of the relationship between Norman  his mother and his victims that will forever remain inherently disturbing and terrifying; but Van Sant is unable to convey that sense of dread  that throat-clenching fear  with this film. If ever there was a movie made that should have been earmarked straight-to-video  this is it. Better still  had it never been born. I rate this one 2/10\n",

It's nice to look at - so are the actors - and if you're into drag queens  I guess you might like it a lot  but the plot and characters are as thin as cardboard. It's one of those politically correct movies that warps everything else in order to make a 'minority lifestyle' seem warm and cuddly. It gets a lot of mileage out of bitchy dialogue  which is amusing in this sanitized form  I guess.   Ninety percent of the action is parading around in gaudy costumes in incongruous situations.

      "Piranha starts out as expected  stupid white people going to discover new lands and exploit them. I thought for a while it might be a cannibal film. It starts off like so many others  showing nothing but shots off untouched Amazon rain forest. For all I know it could be Florida. At this point you figure some animal mutilation or natives will pop up. Instead you get the acting talents of William Smith  who starred in L.A. Vice and Angels Die Hard. He plays Caribe  an acclaimed hunter  who I would describe him as Jack Palance Light. He is bigger in stature  but not quite the Jack Palance goodness. As for natives  you don't really get that many. Where's the piranha? Should I even ask that question? Caribe now hunts humans  I guess. He doesn't really pursue anyone till the end of the movie though  just stares at them. Caribe does race one of the tourists on a motorcycle in a over-dramatic Smokey and the Bandit kind of way. The motorcycle challenge happens for no real reason other than an action sequence. I can't tell you how many times I've seen a tourist challenge a stranger to a motorcycle race in the jungle. Never actually. Do they live  do they die? Will you care? Anybody wanna race on motorcycles? Caution: this film contains extreme dry look. My advice is to rent a Jack Palance classic like Craze.\n",

Not that anyone else is very good in it either  but when you hate the character that is supposed to be garnering your sympathy the movie just fails to work. Funny enough  it looks like a movie is coming out in the near future that has a plot that mirrors this one with more action and a better cast  still though I won't be able to think of anything else  but this film if I were to watch it. This movie has a super dumb clone that is somehow smart enough to figure something is wrong with his camp where people bicycle at one mile per hour and wrestle for no reason. The counselors tell them that when they are ready they go to America  but our hero has his doubts so he snoops around and learns the awful truth which sends him on the run from the bad guys who shoot and hit the guy repeatedly. He goes on the look out for the man he was cloned from. Peter Graves is in it and so is Dick Seargent  but they add nothing to this movie which looks like something that was made for television. On the plus side though when The Island comes out the makers of this film can proudly say we thought of it first.\n",

      "To start off  I love Steven Seagal  the man is a genius. But recent movies leave me to wonder  Is he trying anymore? His latest movies show almost no effort on Seagal's part. In Out of Reach  its too obvious that his lines are dubbed over. . What Seagal does in this movie is not only a slap on the face to his fans  but even more to Jean-Claude Van Damme and his fans. In the 2nd scene or so  when he prepares to zip-line into the drug dealers penthouse to steal the jewels and money  it shows him set-up the gun and hook it on a neon sign. Your might be saying to yourself  'Yah  so what does this have to do with Van Damme?'. Well that scene was stolen from a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie called the Order. Rent both  watch both  compare both and you will lose respect for Seagal. Not only was Today You Die garbage  but it was  dare I say  an insult. Seagal's Aikido moves are still good  but why isn't he doing great movies like Marked for Death or Above the law  hes still got the moves and the attitude  I'm just left wondering 'Why Seagal  Why?'. There are such idiotic scenes in his newer movies that have nothing to do with the storyline  and such idiotic story lines on top of that. I hope the up-coming Black Dawn movie will be another Exit Wounds or Beyond Justice  because these last chain of movies he made  especially Today You Die  really made me wonder if he has the stuff to make more great action movies like Double Team. Please  don't watch this movie unless you hate Seagal  if you love his movies don't watch this  it WILL make you question his future in the action film genre.\n",

      "The Governess was  by far  a very pitiful film. I do not use this word loosely  as it honestly was a poor excuse for a movie. I finished watching this feature with only one word on my mind ",
      " why? Honestly  you could use this question at the end of every scene of this film and it would seem like it fit. There were so many inconsistencies that lead to a lack of development (both in the story and in the characters) which ultimately lead to a very confusing film with actors walking through the motions instead of giving any explanation. Scenes would occur with no foreshadowing  understanding  or drive to a complete ending. It was as if I was watching several different ideas thrown together without really any resolution. Actors were setting events in motion that did not seem to fit their character or really were resolved. This was my biggest issue with this film. The complete and utter lack of structure to this film brought all specks of foundation crumbling down with a genuine ripple-effect being felt throughout the rest of the film as a result.  Let me explain myself further on this lack of consistency throughout the film. I would liken this film to a bowl of lumpy oatmeal that had a zebra in it. It made no sense nor was there any logic behind it all. Minnie Driver was the worst culprit of this deed. Her character's lines were drawn very fuzzy and nearly transparent. She would do things like talk about sex all the time with her sister  but yet she seemed very open to sexual experiences all the time. She has her first moment of passion in this film  and there is no pain or excitement. It nonchalantly happens  and this just didn't seem to fit the original conversation that we had at the beginning of the film with Rosina and her sister. She is a very intelligent woman that accidentally finds a solution to Wilkinson's problem and suddenly wants full rights to his invention? That was confusing and completely random. Is it not obvious to anyone else that her teaching methods were non-existent. Anyone in their right mind could see that she wasn't teaching Cavendish's daughter anything. The sudden and awkward relationship that randomly forms between Driver and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers nearly had me laughing out loud. I thought maybe I had discovered some magic in this film as Rhys-Meyers literally poofed into the scene and suddenly caused some unneeded drama. It felt that the director (or writer) was thinking that the original story was going nowhere fast  so by adding this random character we may be able to advance the plot a bit (or confuse the lesser film enthusiasts). Well  it didn't fool me  I saw that he was nearly a cut-and-paste character used to strengthen an already weakened story. Don't get me started on the ending  which had no consistency to the rest of the story. Again using the cut-and-paste method  the writer of this film needed a way to just end the story  and this was the only solution they could arrive to. It is sad when actors are forced to do things out of character ",
      " but I guess that is the name of the game in Hollywood. Fix until completely broken  or at least salvageable.  The remainder of the story was unexciting dribble. There were maybe a handful of neat cinematography moments where you could see that there was one sliver of creativity trying to peak through coupled with some bars of decent  period piece music  but nothing to write to Grandma about. More family structure with some stronger introductions could have strengthened this film a bit more  but as I stated before  by leaving open-ended scenes just lying around the entire film  you will experience a crack in your foundation. What may seem like a sturdy story  will eventually wear down over time  and by the end of this film I felt that the house was crumbling down on top of me. Wilkinson plays his normal self in this film  while Driver apparently did not want to get naked  but everyone else had too (I will have to see a doctor after those images were burned into my eyes ",
      " eeewwww). Also  she wore the same dress everyday. That was disgusting and I could smell her through the television. Sex and dirty laundry. Now there is a great film for you! There just seemed to be some potential floating around here  but instead it was just rubbish. Nothing was answered  questions seemed to fall like snow in Alaska  and mediocrity seemed to reign supreme.  Overall  this could have been a decent film that combined the powerful themes of science and love together  but instead it was just pitiful. I cannot stress enough the disturbing fact that characters were going through motions without any sort of pre-explanation. I don't need cinematic moments handed to me like a child  but something should have been done to build a foundation. Just remember the oatmeal with a zebra analogy that I used. If you were as confused about that as I was  then you will completely understand the film The Governess  while if you prefer zebras in your oatmeal ",

      "Oh yeah  this one is definitely a strong contender to win the questionable award of worst 80's slasher ever made. The Prey has got everything you usually want to avoid in a horror flick: a routine  derivative plot that you've seen a thousand times before (and better)  insufferable characters and terrible performances  a complete lack of gore and suspense  fuzzy photography and unoriginal locations and  most irritating of all  the largest amount of pointless padding footage you've ever encountered in your life (and that's not an exaggeration but a guarantee!). Apart from the seemingly endless amount of National Geographic stock footage  which I'll expand upon later  this film is shameless enough to include a complete banjo interlude (!) and two occasions where characters tell dillydally jokes that aren't even remotely funny! The set-up is as rudimentary as it gets  with the intro showing images of a devastating forest fire with OTT voice-over human screams. Fast forward nearly forty years later  when an elderly couple out camping in that same area get axe-whacked by something that breathes heavily off-screen. This ought to be enough information for you to derive that someone survived the fire all these years ago and remained prowling around ever since. Enter three intolerable twenty something couples heading up to the danger zone with exclusively sex on their minds  unaware of course they are sitting ducks for the stalking and panting killer. The Prey is an irredeemable boring film. Apparently it was shot in 1978 already  but nobody wanted to distribute it up until 1984 and it isn't too hard to see why. In case you would filter out all the content that is actually relevant  this would only be a short movie with a running time of 30 minutes; possibly even less. There's an unimaginably large of nature and wildlife footage  sometimes of animals that I think don't even live in that type of area  and they seem to go on forever. The only thing missing  in fact  is the typical National Geographic narration providing educational information regarding the animals' habits. Animals in their own natural biotope are undeniably nice to look at  but not in a supposedly vile and cheesy 80's slasher movie  for crying out loud. The last fifteen minutes are finally somewhat worthwhile  with some potent killing sequences and fine make-up effects on the monster (who turns out to be Lurch from The Addams Family movies)  but still silliness overrules  the scene with the vultures is too stupid  and the final shot is just laugh-out-loud retarded. As mentioned above  The Prey easily makes my own personal list of worst 80's slashers  alongside Appointment with Fear  Berserker  Deadly Games  Don't Go in the Woods  Hollow Gate  The Stay Awake and Curfew.\n",

No it's not Lamont Cranston  it's some dude who gives his orders through an open wall safe so his men don't see who he is. But the voice is unmistakable  you'll know within 10 minutes of the film.   And another reviewer here is quite wrong  no squeals or groans from the audience would have occurred because Gabby Hayes was still playing a variety of roles and he's clean shaven here. He had not yet found his niche as the lovable oldtimer sidekick of various movie cowboy heroes like the Duke.  Later on he does lead his men quite openly in the climax so I'm not sure what the point of the original gimmick with the wall safe was. I don't think those that wrote this one knew either.  Wayne gets Yakima Canutt as an Indian sidekick here and the relationship is just about the same as an unmasked Lone Ranger and Tonto.  It's all pretty silly if you ask me.\n",

      "I must say I was really excited about this film before renting it as it was an Adam Sandler Happy Madison production and I am usually attracted to that type of silly humour.  There were a few funny moments at the beginning of the film  but this film lacked everything that makes a good movie. I realize that many filmsthat are not realistic can still be quite funny  but this film was unrealistic and not funny at all. The acting was horrible  the cinematography was very poor  the plot made no sense at all. I cannot get over the fact that 3 classy older ladies would even work for such poor writing. Overall I was very unimpressed with this film and I do not recommend wasting 5 bucks on renting it.\n",

      "I don't know how this movie has received so many positive comments. One can call it artistic and beautifully filmed  but those things don't make up for the empty plot that was filled with sexual innuendos. I wish I had not wasted my time to watch this movie. Rather than being biographical  it was a poor excuse for promoting strange and lewd behavior. It was just another Hollywood attempt to convince us that that kind of life is normal and OK. From the very beginning I asked my self what was the point of this movie and I continued watching  hoping that it would change and was quite disappointed that it continued in the same vein. I am so glad I did not spend the money to see this in a theater!\n",

      "For a movie that gained so much recognition and appraise this spinoff to Rosemarys Baby is one big mistake. It starts off that Andrew/Adrian whatever his name is because he's so confused that he doesn't know who he is anymore runs away from a cult with his mother and soon is kidnapped by a strange lady that ends up taking care of him as if she were his mother. The acting is terrible as Andrew grows up in his twenties and looks terrible with his sunken in face  never ending grin and Dukes of Hazard clothes on looks more like a drunken has been than the son of Satan. In fact thats all he does is drink and falls sloppily all over himself as he tries to come to grips with his past and the last memory of his mother driving away on a bus screaming to him. He finds a friend that seems to be an angel but he's quickly killed off and electricuted in a hillarious scene in which he looks more like a Christmas tree. Andrew gets cought and the cult with the members of the first part test him to see if he's really the Son of Satan. His dumb self fails the test and gets up off the alter glittering with myme makeup and jumps of the stage of a night club and dances like a clown on crack!!! This scene is memorable and well worth a watch. The ending is terrible and somewhat predictable considering how stupid he is in the whole movie. Do not watch this piece of trash or you will loose respect for the first part.\n",

      "Shuttle is/was more than a boring movie that had an interesting start  but after half an hour it ended in the worst imaginable way I ever could imagine. This movie has lost its story  if you can call it a story? ... after half an hour. All the next scenes are totally out of proportion. The driver is some kind of superman because he survives every attack with gun - knife etc.. even after stabbed in his leg he was able to put her in the box. But what a coincidence that there was a box in that garage. I really felt sick and misled when the movie ended. It could have been such a great one if the story was far more better. In my opinion even a kid would make a better story. And why shipping the girl with water and food. I quit with counting the plot holes about halfway through. And when the movie reached its almost admirably sick over-the-top final twist  I had completely given up (better say throw-up). The worst thing about Shuttle is actually that it can not be even more worse that worse. Maybe writer/director Anderson will learn from this lesson and provide us with a decent thriller next time. Think the better he'll move to a different genre. I Keep my fingers crossed. But from now on I will read the comment on his future movies first before looking. A waste of time.\n",

The characters were disjointed and didn't fit any discernible pattern of reality. The dialog between characters was forced and at times very confusing.

      "Sorry  but I usually love French thrillers - e.g. Chabrol - but this was a glossy shambolic mess. The fact that it was based on a Harlan Cohen book is telling  because rather than being a French film (strong on psychology and character)  it's more like a John Grisham-esquire roller-coaster ride by numbers with ludicrous plot twists  flashbacks that update previous flashbacks  a predictable villain (as soon as his name is mentioned you think 'hmm  he'll be the bad guy!') and sets of mysterious stereotyped characters who seem to inhabit different movies. By the end I was laughing hysterically at the unevenness of the film's tone (the scenes where the lead character is being helped by two streetwise shady characters are unintentionally hilarious)  the utterly baffling plot  the absurd coincidences and strokes of good fortune (e.g. guessing the password for an email account) AND yawning uncontrollably (thought I must have misread the 1hr 50min running time as it seemed to drag on for 3 hours 50 minutes).\n",

It contains some of the worst attempts at comedy I've ever witnessed with mediocre acting to boot. The supposed humor within the show is all based on saying someone's lines again with poor sarcasm  poor sarcasm  saying bad one-liners  and  well  you get the picture.

The show's about a young girl  Carly  putting on a web-show with her friends  which I can say is without a doubt a nicer version of the internet. That's fine  but the show's just...well  not funny at all  as previously stated.

Set in a gritty parallel universe where everything is owned by the Blump Corporation  it concerns a horrible stand-up comic who finds success when he grows a third arm out of his back.  All the potential for great cheese is here -- washed-up 80's star Judd Nelson  Wayne Newton  offbeat visuals and strange plot digressions  obese women in skimpy lingerie  necrophilia -- but it never pays off.  The pacing is the main problem. Each scene is excrutiatingly slow. Nelson's stand-up routines are supposed to be funny because they're pathetically not funny. But each performance drags on until it's not even tangentially funny  just boring.  Imagine someone telling you the longest  weirdest joke imaginable  full of smirky self-congratulation for how funny and weird he thinks it is.

      "This review is for the UK DVD three-disc box set. Disc one is called Caught in the Act and contains Model Behavior  Chasing Jamie and Fast and Curious. Disc two is called Bedroom Fantasies and contains Blue Plate Special  Falling in Lust Again and Love Potion No. 10. The final disc is called Anything Goes and contains Chatroom  She's the Boss and Legally Yours. Why the other four episodes in the series are not included is a mystery because there is surely enough room on the discs for a lot more material.  Each episode opens with the hotel manager Chloe (Lauren Hayes) reading a letter from a satisfied customer. We then get to see the story unfolding as the guests check into the hotel. Blue Plate Special is the exception because this story is from a waitress. The writers should be given credit for coming up with a good variety of story lines. For instance  Model Behavior is about two models vying for the attention of the photo crew; Falling in Lust Again is about a man and woman who parted and rekindle their love when they meet up again at the hotel; She's the Boss is about a put-upon male secretary/dogsbody who shows that he is more of a man than his female boss realised - much to her pleasure. All the episodes lead up to lots of nudity and sex.  It should come as no surprise that all the characters in this hotel are beautiful women and handsome hunks. Even the geeky secretaries get transformed when they remove their spectacles and let their hair down. The sex action is plentiful but to me seems too frantic and false. The camera work could also have done with a bit of moderation  spending too much time close up and so moving about to capture everything  and as usual we get loud music during the sex action. Finally  the end credits mention the Palm Canopy Hotel  Singer Island  Florida although my map of Florida shows no Singer Island. The scenery certainly looks more like Florida than Utah or Las Vegas that some people have mentioned. This is quite a good effort and it is a pity that the second series is still awaiting a UK DVD release. 4 stars.\n",

      "John Sayles  what have you done?  Silver City had moments in which I could see the glimmering hope of a good story  well-drawn characters  thought provoking dialog. And then those moments would quickly be covered over by layers of poor writing  clumsy direction  and abysmal acting. I truly love almost all of John Sayles' work  but Silver City is ghastly.  I got the feeling that Sayles may have been working on the beginnings of a good story involving the illegal labor and industrial corruption plot lines  but then he got rushed and stuck the secondary plot line satirizing the Bush administration onto it. The two stories don't really connect with each other  and the weaker elements of the political theme dominate the first 3/4 of the movie  causing me to lose patience with the whole affair.  The other major flaw is Danny Huston's acting. His dialog in every scene is delivered with a gawping grin  regardless of its appropriateness to the mood. I hated this guy by the end of the film  having been reminded of every bad actor in every high school play I've ever seen. Not having seen Huston in anything else  I don't know whether to blame him or to blame Sayles' direction of him more. Regardless  he's the unfortunate focal point of a very unfortunate movie.  Right down to the last sledgehammer-subtle final scene I was disappointed by Silver City. Sayles at his best  or heck  even Sayles at mediocre  can be so very much better than this film. See ANY of his other works instead. This isn't even worth a rental.\n",

      "Not for the first time  I'm out of kilter with the majority view. Oz is a dreadful  pretentious  voyeuristic series. The makers have their cake and eat it. Oz  Em City  etc are used as ultra- crude signals that the apparent grittiness is complete fantasy. This allows viewers the feeblest of intellectual excuses to watch soap operatic nonsense spiced with everything that is bad about human beings.  When you watch an episode  please remember that while the foul-mouthed  violent  absurdly convoluted  unconvincing  sick  imaginary drama unfolds before your approving eyes  several hundred infants in poorer parts of the world have died from bad food or water.  Oz is exploitative drama at its worst. It appeals to the basest instincts but pretends to be serious and meaningful. It blows hot and cold and changes from fortissimo to pianissimo more often than a Mahler symphony.  Dialogue is unrelentingly ugly and utilitarian. The liberties taken with realities are stupid. Here's a nightclub owning dandy  arriving at Oz in his foppish finery  complete with a ridiculously cloudy contact lens in one eye  brandishing a stash of drugs that nobody detected. Here's a murderous wimp bleating about the heat death of the universe  begging to be killed  but of course being refused by the brute he approaches and doing a bit of improbable throat cutting himself.  The action races on at a pace fast enough for the voyeuristic  dim-witted viewer to be thinking always about what happens next rather than the rubbish that has just been shown. Don't worry  a betrayal  a murder  a sex scene will be along within a minute or two.   Finally  Oz is obviously pretentious. You don't have to feel embarrassed about being carried along by its flow. You can watch it and tell yourself that the producers  writers and actors are doing everything with a huge wink (or same word but for a change of vowel) to the audience.   Yes  you can be a nasty-minded viewer and excuse yourself on the grounds of the cleverness  post-modernistic  etc skills of the Oz production team. They appeal to the lowest common denominator while pretending to operate on a higher plane.  Truly  a despicable series. And every hour it shows  rewarding its makers and actors  and generating advertising revenue for the channels that show it to people who have nothing better to do than watch something so ugly and unnecessary  another few hundred children die whose lives could have been saved by the dollars spent by this horrible  successful  widely-praised series.\n",

In one of film's greatest years  1999  Detroit Rock City contends with Runaway Bride and Wild Wild West for the bottom spot in a barrel of junkies. The plot is masterful. Four scrawny high school youngsters finally have their chance at seeing the hard rock theatrics of KISS for",
      "the third year in a row. So when their tickets are toiled by an ultra-religious  chain-smoking mom  the pals scramble themselves in getting to Detroit  and I'm sure you can figure out the rest.  Well  not exactly; the movie does go to extreme measures in explaining how the four band members (no  not Gene  Paul  Ace and Peter) go about getting these tickets: losing your virginity in a confessional; saving a smoked-out bimbo and your mom's Volvo (from the Soprano's Steve Schirripa  nonetheless); preventing a robbery in the midst of botching one for a 12-year-old's debt; and of course  stripping down to your bare essentials for MC Ron Jeremy after shuttling a full blender with bourbon-leftovers. Sounds funny  doesn't it? Perhaps Detroit Rock City does have a point with all this tomfoolery in how extreme sometimes these fans can go. And we do understand this movie is a comedy; it is supposed to be filled with slapstick. But does Detroit Rock City aim to the proper audience? It is rated R  meaning the only way prepubescent adolescents-the audience as I see it  to which many will eventually hail this one a classic-will voyeur is through illegal terms.  Detroit Rock City also fails at giving itself the late-1970's touch. The camera's texture quality is way too clear and way too bright  missing the necessary flair from films like This is Spinal Tap and Sid & Nancy. This would've allowed audiences to feel `more at home' with the times. Simply costuming kids into pre-90's grunge-wear and settling others into `disco infernos' does not do the trick. Environment does mean something you know; I doubt Detroit looked this glamorous in '78. If there's anything positive coming from this movie it's the kick-ass soundtrack of hard late-70 to early-80's rock. Van Halen  AC/DC  you name it  it's all here. Of course we can't forget KISS  the band aptly subjected throughout.  What the film noticeably fails to manage are questions concerning why the Knights of Satin's Service (it's really just KISS) were so frowned upon by moms around the nation. Sure  the loud rock and devilish makeup might be a part of that; encouragements for youth to explore themselves and have a good time might be fair reasons as well. But  what is KISS saying in the music we hear throughout the film towards this highly rebellious group? What separates these anthems of `rock[ing] and roll[ing] all night and partying everyday' from the rest of the music? Most likely  these questions will remain in a music communication class and not in the films that should answer them  simply because it is KISS and they rock and we must do everything in our God-forgiven power to see them.  1.5/5 stars\n",

What the hell  there was more pine trees and snow in Ravenous and that was suppose to be shot in Californa.   OK  for those who know nothing about Ed Gein  I would like to give you  your history lesson. Ed Gein was thought to have killed his family  but it was never proved. He killed a bartender  she was shot at bar close when no one was around. He took the DEAD bartender back to his house. 10 years later he SHOT and killed the store clerk  he stoled the cash register and the store truck. He was caught because of this murder  he came in the day before when her son was there and asked about antifreeze. The day he killed her  he was in there buying the antifreeze  and the reciept that only had antif..... was the only evidence they had to start a world wide man hunt. He robbed graves  in fact in robbed 56 graves. He hate the people he dug up and he made furinture; lamp shades  couches  chairs  and other things.   He had a family that he had dinner with once and awhile and they threw all the meat he ever gave them out when he was caught  considering he was caught at their house. He was arrested and hid in the back of a cop car  in fear of what may happen to him. How do I know all of this? I read the book the judge that tried him wrote.   After this movie was over  after watching the whole horrific thing  not only am I offended by the directors horriable view on what Wisconsin women look like. I mean it was hard to tell who this guy had on the slab half the time  you know cause Wisconsin women are all BLONDES. Please! I am overly offended by the lack of homework this guy did and the poor job he did making this movie. I have no idea who this Kane guy is and I think he may be OK in something else  but he did a horrible job playing Ed Gein.   After all of this I am so sad I wasted the 3.99 on the movie.   Movie after finished was completely untrue  this movie is like me saying that the world is flat and George Washington wasn't our first president. Come on people  that is your history  and this is Wisconsin's history. To end this rant  how would all of you feel if I made a movie and George Washington looked like Brad Pitt (some of you may think that is fine  but it would be not true) and he lived and wasn't the president and whatever. You can't rewrite history.\n",

      "SILVER CITY (2+ outta 5 stars) As a huge fan of John Sayles' work for many years now I feel safe in saying that this is the worst movie he has ever done. That said  the movie isn't exactly *terrible*... just very uninspired. Sayles throws in familiar elements from his previous movies (corrupt politics  illegal immigration  the selling out of youthful ideals) but fails to bring them together in any new or meaningful way. Even the dialogue (usually Sayles' strong point) is disappointing this time around.. sounding clichéd and forced in almost every scene. The movie looks and sounds like episodes from a TV series that didn't make it past its third episode. There are tons of big stars on hand... and they try their best to make their bit parts come alive... but the material just isn't there this time around. While filming a campaign spot a governor-hopeful (a poor and obvious George W Bush stand-in) fishes a dead body out of a lake. An investigator is hired to try and warn away people who may have deliberately set this up to discredit the candidate... but he soon finds out that there are deeper and darker (and more clichéd) secrets to be discovered. Sayles has made similarly-themed movies so much better in the past (Lone Star  Matewan  Return of the Secaucus Seven  Men With Guns). It's a shame that he went to the well one time too many and came up with tainted water. One good line  delivered by Richard Dreyfuss: Danny  you're a loser. That's already been established beyond doubt. So just try and be a good one  okay?\n",

      "I truly hate and despise this film and the filmmakers behind it.  Sure  I'm all for making a hard hitting and honest film about youth and youth culture.1987's River's Edge is an excellent example of a well-made teen drama. However  what I take exception to is the infantile  grubby and sensationalist approach that the makers of 2:37 took.  A prime example is how it raises so many issues and yet fails in any significant way to comment or reach a resolution on even one of them.  My other major problem with this film  apart from its complete plagiarism of Gus Van Sant's Elephant (surprised Van Sant didn't sue) is its 'bull loose in a china shop' attitude to quite delicate issues such as incest and particularly suicide.  In short  avoid this film like the plague and anything that this filmmaker ever is involved with subsequently. I've heard that his motivation for making 2:37 may or may not be based on lies. Having seen the substandard result  this doesn't surprise me in the slightest. This is a glorified student film exercise that has no place whatsoever being in a cinema or on DVD. Pure and simple.\n",

      "Like anyone else who bought this  I was duped by the 20 pieces of extreme gore and banned in 20 countries or whatever it says in the box. I have to admit I am a huge gore fan and I am always amazed when films can lay it on thick and look convincing doing it. Tom Savini  Rick Baker and Greg Cannom are some of the best in the business. The revolutionized make-up effects in the 80's. Today  you don't need them as everything is done on computer. But computers cannot compare to the visual wizardry that these three men could conjure up. But I digress.  Watching fantastically gory films like Fulci's Gates to Hell or even Savini's crowning achievement  Friday the 13th the Final Chapter  you can appreciate all that goes into making a terrifically gory film. You can't tell the difference between reality and magic.  I can't imagine another reason why anyone would see Cannibal Ferox but the gore that is ostensibly omnipotent in this film. If that is the reason you seek this film  then you are wasting your money. As many other reviewers in here have noted  most of the gore is an aftermath. You don't see the torture  or the bloodshed as it happens  you see whatever it looks like afterwords.  The gore? Well  it's here  but not as much as one would hope  or expect. A man does get castrated and a women does get hanged by her breasts  but other then those two scenes  and one involving a scalping; there is nothing really much else to this film. The scenes of gore even in these three mentioned  are still pretty tame in comparison to what you were hoping for. Maybe it's just me and my sick and twisted experience in the horror and gore genre  but I was expecting a bit more. Call me sick or twisted  but isn't that the only reason people are watching this film in the first place? I honestly found myself bored in a lot of places.  Cannibal Ferox is just another film that tries to capitalize on a craze of a superior film. While Cannibal Holocaust is not exactly a great film  it is much better than this tripe. If you go out of your way to buy this for $20.00  you will feel cheated.  3/10\n",

      "I went to see this movie to kill some time. I remember Cole Hauser in Tigerland  and although his acting is wooden  he does portray a tough leader character. Same here. This movie was about a bunch of young  hot scientists and divers exploring a cave in Romania that one has to dive to see. The beginning scene was very interesting  with a bunch of Romanian or Russian men exploring the cave in search of booty. Flash forward 30 years  and we have a team of divers called in by some scientist and his crew to explore some cave for some unknown scientific purpose.   There is a lot of clichéd  useless talk. The women are too hot for their jobs  let's face it. I hate to watch the lips of these women talk about the guys while drinking beer at the pre-cave exploration party. I mean it was like we were at some bar with frat and sorority types talking about the opposite sex--not a group of scientists and divers. Every character had ZERO personality  with perhaps exception of the scientist  who at least wasn't one of the young and beautiful people. So  the acting  although workmanlike  was not inspiring.   The dialog was pretty bad. At one point in the movie  Cole Hauser (Jack)  the lead diver--his irises morph into the Cingular wireless symbol  and stay like that. We are led to believe that  since he was scratched by one of these monsters  that he is turning into one of them. Fair enough. But first of all  nobody says the obvious thing to him: What is up with your EYES  dude?? No. Everybody just talked about how he's changed and that he should not be the leader of the group anymore. And then this guy says  you see how he's not HUMAN. Huh? If they really believed he was a friggin' monster  then why not act like it? Instead  the group splits in two--those who go with Jack  and those who go their separate ways  I guess thinking him to be a monster. It makes no sense.  The best scene in the movie was this blonde diver woman crawls up a cave wall  and gets attacked by this goblin. Her scream really sucked--but she fought like hell to dispatch the goblin.  The photography was fine when the camera was STILL. But any action sequences  the director found it useful to confuse the hell out of us by flashing bubbles  flashlights  dark space  god knows what. I wish they would just show us a scene straight once in awhile. Just because you move the camera all over the place doesn't make the movie any SCARIER  folks.   This movie could have been a lot better if the following changes had been made:  1. every actor was replaced by someone who looked real. Let Cole Hauser be the lead  it's OK to let him be the good-looking one. I'm getting tired of seeing 20-something supermodel scientists. Give me a break  people!  2. The cinematographer was fired  and replaced by one who just pointed the camera and sat still. This could be the director's fault  I don't know. Jumpy camera (as in Constant Gardener) is getting old  folks.  3. We got to see the goblins actually devour the people. How bout some gore? There's not much else in this movie. We barely got to see the creatures--I felt a little ripped off about that.   4. The ending was pretty lame. During the denouement  the sexy British scientist has a secret...guess what that is? It's a bit canned. The ending would have been better if they all died instead of the Black guy (Morris Chestnut)  who seemed to breathe a little sympathy into his character just by his worried expressions. All the other actors had NO expression.  I gave it a 4 out of 10  because after all  the acting was without noticeable errors  and the concept was fairly original. I'd like to see Cole do more military roles--he's good at it.\n",

      "I appeared as an extra and was on location as a journalist covering The Dain Curse. My involvement was during the segments of this film shot in Jim Thorpe  Pa. (Jim Thorpe was also one of the locations of the 1969 film The Molly Maguires). I reported the 'action' in the Emmaus Free Press newspaper where I was editor 1978-80 (the paper ceased publication int he 1990s). I recall the excellent attention to detail of the period costumes  automobiles  etc. The modern asphalted streets of Jim Thorpe were covered with gravel to mimic a 1920s rural town of the south. At the time  I interviewed the producer and spoke briefly with the director during a set change break; I did not get to interview James Coburn which was always a great disappointment to me. As an aside  I appear briefly in one of the street scenes wearing a snap- brim hat and a tweed jacket. The producer asked me to jump in and it was a real thrill. I still have a collection of black and white stills I took of the production work for the newspaper. Someday  they may be of interest to film/television historians.--Lou Varricchio\n",

      "If you're in the mood to laugh at a truly bad movie (bad in the way only Ken Russell at his worst can be)  you must try this one. It succeeds in making you feel like you just landed in a .25 porn-booth  and you can just about smell the urine on the floor. Kathleen Turner struts around in a blond wig  getting her kicks from pretending to be a two-bit hooker (she really has a good solid job in the clothing industry and has been hurt so badly by men that this is the only way she can connect)  and Tony Perkins plays a hysterical priest who is out to maybe murderer her (yet another movie that ends with Tony Perkins in drag). Annie Potts shows up and is not allowed to provide an ounce of her usual wit  which is reason enough to hate this movie. The kinky will love the sex scenes  so rent the UNrated version in the RED box so you can see Turner give a cop a taste of his billy club (I had to pause the VCR until we stopped laughing).\n",

      "No wonder a lot of us hate classical music; and what are the children to think? With educational PR like this  serious music will soon slip from life support to the morgue. Kids know when they're being talked down to  and this is no exception; why can't someone good do a movie about classical music for kids? I must admit  I enjoyed the actor who played Beethoven  he took to the role with enthusiasm and a keen balance of the poignant and humorous aspects of Beethoven's character; he obviously did his research. Otherwise  this is a third rate rehash of the old ABC Afterschool Special format  with none of the occasional charm those short films had. Sorry about the rant  but this is an important subject for young people to know about  and it could have been done well; I wonder if musicians or filmmakers were responsible?

      "I got this movie as a buy one get one deal at troma.com with The Ruining (which isn't much better). The main reason I wanted it was to see Star Worms II: Attack of the Pleasure Pods  the DVD is a double feature with that movie. I really didn't know what Actium Maximus was at the time  and when I saw the trailer I got scared. It looked awful. But hey  what can you tell from the trailer? Well  apparently I could tell a lot. This movie honestly made no sens to me. The special effects were so terrible you cannot tell what in God's name is going on. I understand Mark HIcks had a extremely low budget  but come on. And it is sad  because in the interview he sounded like this was to be an epic film and meant more than you could see. But sadly  watching the film is one of the most boring hour and 15 minutes of anyone's life. It is so utterly painful to sit through. I really can't even explain the plot to you because I didn't understand it at all and I have sadly seen this film two times! Apparently they used some type of puppets for the alien dinosaurs like they did in Star Wars. But these special effects are awful  I can't stress it enough. And most of the time bad special effects are okay but this film needed them badly. It takes place on some futuristic planet where alien dinosaurs battle each other and bad actors in hooded sweatshirts run around  and they look like they are in the kkk. And some box with a blue light on it is the president. I know in the interview Mark Hicks said something about making this a television pilot  well  I can see why this didn't make it to CBS or NBC. There are two good things about this film. 1. the music is actually pretty good  it has an epic score that sticks in your head for days. And 2. Lloyd Kaufman's introduction is as always hilarious. Overall  don't waste your time but check out Star Worms II: Attack of the Pleasure Pods!\n",

      "I tried watching this movie  but I didn't make it past the first 15 minutes. It's a terrible disappointment  considering the cast  but I can't look past the fact that the dialogue is in English and some of the actors pretending to be Indian are not even close (read: Kristin Kreuk). Considering that India alone has 1/6th of the world's population and one of the biggest movie industries  I don't think it would have been hard for the film-makers to have found an excellent Indian actress to play the part. And I don't say so because of some blind patriotism  but because it's absolutely and totally absurd for a non-Indian to play the role of an Indian/Pakistani. Now some people say that 'as long as she's convincing who cares?' but my point is exactly that she's NOT convincing and never can be - not due to her acting skills  but due to her ethnicity. For example  however good an actor Tom Hanks may be  he'll never be able to play an Australian Aborigine!  But that is still minor to the biggest faux pas the film-makers made: having the dialogue in English. It totally destroys the mood  as well as any semblance of authenticity. Had the same movie been made in native languages (Hindi  Urdu  Punjabi) with English subtitles  this may have been an excellent movie. Unfortunately  as things stand  I would not recommend anyone seeing it  apart from film students who want to study What not to do in movies.\n",

      "Let me begin by saying that this remade version of one of the greatest ever created movies Psycho (1960) has been nothing but a fine example of poor direction  poor acting and poor cast. The best way to describe this movie is by comparing it step by step  acting by acting and process by process to the original.  Alfred Hitchcock  one of the greatest movie directors ever lived  had an intention to shoot the original in black and white despite the availability of color at that time. Okay  people in 1960 may not have been used to bloodshed or horrifying scenes as much as we are today but that didn't prevent people from liking it and getting nominated for 4 Oscars. Gus Van Sant had absolutely no reason to release this in color except that the year was 1998. What should have looked realistic in color did not. After the shower scene Norman washes his hands it is easily comprehendible that whatever was used for blood looked like some kind of red wax. Once he washes off the blood his hand is red in color.   About acting  perhaps there couldn't have been a better cast of Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins in the original. Perkins suited well for Norman and he was incredibly natural when he smiles and talks to the stranger. Hitch wanted a handsome and good actor and it worked just fine. In this version  I personally think Vince Vaughn looked perfect and handsome and strong to play Norman's role  unfortunately his acting was nothing less than terrible. In the motel office where Norman and Marion have the long conversation  he had zero expression on his face and his voice and face never changes throughout. In the original in the same scene when the madhouse is described  we can clearly see the sudden change of expression on Perkins's face and he looks scaringly angry although not aggressively. Vince Vaughn here works out the entire conversation like he's just had his lines by heart. Again  terrible acting. Same is with Anne Heche. In the opening scene in the original  we can see how tensed and nervous Marion (Janet) is when she drives to Phoenix. She was happy in getting the money but at the same time scared for life. That's what I call acting. In the remake  Heche has no signs of fear and she smiles periodically for getting the money. I don't think anyone would be happy and smiling when they've just stolen $400000 and the entire state police is behind them. In the shower scene  Janet in the original grips the curtain  turns around and dies after getting stabbed. In the remake  Heche gets stabbed  turns around  then sways the other way  has a foolish expression on her face and manages to die with great effort. Again  terrible acting.  There are also some specially introduced changes in this movie from the original that seems to have nothing to do with the plot line and the ongoing situation. In the scene where Arbogast gets murdered  two scenes blink in between the stabs. One with a naked woman and the other with a sheep. Many people including myself aren't exactly sure whether the second scene showed a sheep or a cow or whatever it was. What on earth does a beast or a naked woman have to do with an investigator's murder! The changes were just inappropriate and unnecessary. There are a couple of changes in the ending scene as well.   Let me add some (and the only) positive points along with that. I felt Julianne Moore did her job well and played a good character of Lila. And William Macy acted well  that was almost exactly how Arbogast's character should have been played.  It is common man's knowledge that the purpose and intention of a movie remake is to make the present generation aware of a movie that has a good classic plot line  and to try and make it look better than the original. And if anything has happened here according to what I just said  it is directly the opposite. Unfortunately many people like me weren't impressed after watching this movie unless we came to know of the existence of an unforgettable original version.   Please do not watch this movie  it is nowhere near the original and the original will always remain one of the best ever created movies if not THE best.\n",

Then we get to the Martian scenes  where everyone on Mars wears goofy hats. They have a revolution after being inspired by the Earth Men  but are quickly betrayed by the Queen who sides with them.

      "I expected so much more than what I received from watching this movie. It is not that I object to literary license  (if that is what it should be called) especially when there is no overt attempt to say based on a true story. But this movie is about Beethoven -- a real historical person who is so widely known and so deeply embedded into our musical experiences and I expected the movie to be true to history at least in the primary elements. This movie took such great exception from the historic record it could only disappoint.  My assumption (because I had not researched the movie at all) was that it was true. Half way through  I stopped the movie to look it up on IMDb. The rest of the movie was a remarkably different experience. I was relieved that this was not accurate with history because it was so hard to believe a major portion of the story. To enjoy this movie  I was required to recognize it as a fantasy  a what if it was like this story. The movie lacked this honest disclaimer.  What disappointed me most was the fictionalized conducting of the 9th symphony. The very concept portrayed in the film stretched my imagination to the point of incredulity. I ended up doubting anything was true to history other than Ludwig van Beethoven and his relationship with Karl van Beethoven.  I really enjoyed the performance of Ed Harris - an exceptional actor who knows how to play a role and keep himself out of it and that was about it and for that I give it a 3/10.  Those who portend that this movie is as good as or better than Amadeus have not a clue about either either composers life and are looking only for what this movie really is  for in the end it was a cheap novel of a story - pulp fiction.\n",

      "OK  I read the director's comment about this movie (featured as the 'frontmost comment')  and I have to admit that I can identify with his position.  Micheal  I hope your career recovered from this particular setback and you went on to other  better things. I've seen this movie in the MST3K form. Even with all the chopped continuity and snotty remarks being tossed out by the robots  I saw a potentially decent movie with an ambitious set of ideas trying to struggle out from under the limited budget and limited actors available to it. And this is one of those films (Mitchell is another) where the MST3K crew took a lot of cheap shots at the lead character even when she actually deserved better. You know they had some unfair fun at the actress' expense because it made for a livelier episode.  IMO  the fact that the movie actually tried to be ABOUT something  and had a few decent  effective moments here and there  should keep it out of the 'Bottom 100' (Tangents/Time Chasers is another movie with a plot and a heart that doesn't deserve to be there either).  But it is still not a very good movie. I don't blame the writer/lead actress for being who she is. It's just that her acting and writing skills needed a few more years to mature before she could pull off a vanity project such as this or carry a feature film. The writing and characterization is amateurish and slapdash  and the dialog is often barely up to ABC Afterschool Special standards. The cast sincerely gives it their best effort  and the acting in general is definitely head-and-shoulders above abortions like Future War or Space Mutiny  but there aren't any really professional level performances here  with the exception of 'Big Joe' Estevez  who is hammy but suitably intense. I never saw the full original cut  but MST's sampling of Soultaker was representative enough to make these facts plain.  Oh  and the film has Robert Z'Dar in it. That is  IMO  a real 'Kiss Of Death' for any movie that hopes to be taken seriously. Yes  he's big and scary looking in his role  but I just hate the guy as an actor. (In real life  I wish him well and hope he is financially comfortable).  There were little things I liked about the film. For instance  the camaraderie between the male lead and his dead buddy added some warmth and humor to the movie and made it a lot more watchable. The idea of an elevator in the hospital that opened its doors to the Afterlife was an inspired way to invoke some spooky vibes without springing for special effects  and I respected whoever worked that into the script in attempt to keep the budget manageable. It didn't really work  but it might have with just a little more tweaking.  So anyway  Mr. Rissi  better luck with your other projects - your involvement with this misfire wouldn't keep me from watching something else you did if the 'buzz' was good. And Ms. Miller has nothing to be ashamed of - she was young and ambitious  and the movie wasn't THAT bad.\n",

      "This is clearly a French film. It is about young group of idealist/revolutionary/anarchistic people. It moves very slowly. Long takes. LOng closeups. A minute or more devoted to an attempt to light a pipe full of hash/opium. A long take on how a group overturns a car and burns it. It is a black and white film. The subtitles were white  so about a third of the time they were unreadable. (Why do they do this?) I walked out after about an hour and three quarters when it became clear that this picture was going nowhere  slow. I was not the first to walk out. It was the first time I walked out of a picture in my long lifetime. (Well  maybe the second.)\n",

      "Some Plot Spoilers Ahead.  The Nashville Network's so-called rebirth as The First Network for Men is a complete disappointment  as was its block of adult cartoons. The new Ren and Stimpy was just plain awful  Gary the Rat mediocre at best  and Stripperella pretty unwatchable. This cartoon is mostly boring; if Ren and Stimpy suffered from gross-out overkill  Stripperella lacked any decent shock gags  funny witless gags  clever gags  or gags  period. The concept is bad to begin with: Pamela Anderson  a stripper-cum-superheroine  saves The City from an assortment of goofy supervillains. This cartoon seems like an homage to superior wacky superhero spoofs  like Darkwing Duck and The Tick  but without those cartoons' wit and good writing---or even good storyboarding. Agent 0069 tries to vacillate between being goofy and sexy  but she is neither  and this cartoon's failure to make her one or the other brings this series down.  Watch your taped episodes of The Tick  and see what a real superhero spoof cartoon is like.\n",

      "I will never  ever forget watching this show around the age of 13. Even at the young age I remember thinking  This is a Baywatch rip off show without the one thing that makes Baywatch tolerable. The girls in bathing suits. Nonetheless I was too small in those days to be the holder of the remote in my house. The high point of Pacific Blue was an episode in which a couple of thugged out gangsters are coming to whack someone with submachine guns ... on bikes!!! As a thirteen year old I never laughed so hard at something that was supposed to be taken seriously. Even I knew that the task of going out and acquiring Uzis (for murder) is a task that should never come before borrowing someones car for the day. That had been the defining moment of this show.

      "What the heck is this about? Kelly (jennifer) seems to drop all moral behavior as soon as she arrives to the island. She finds this Juan P (Manuel) existing and exotic  though she witnessed when he slapped his ex in the face  which he also justify later on in the movie  right or wrong? These two guys are the first to find each other on the island. Kelly are totally lost in every sense and the great Juan P can fish and built a somewhat house. Mr handyman. They seem to have a great time. Then Billy Zane (Jack  Kellys characters husband) shows up and of course  two days without knowing what his wife has been doing whit this gorgeous Juan P  he is a little bit jealous. Billy Z is the stereotype rich guy and maybe not the nicest man in the world. He dislikes Juan P (for hitting his girlfriend at the pier  who can blame him? Hes also is arrogant  but he paid loads of money to rent that boat and Juan P who is the waiter/everything cant even fetch him a beer whit in 20 min. Wouldn't you be upset? Yet Billy is probably the guy you want to punch in the face if you meet him. But at the same time  he is  not to be blamed for  suspicious about the scuba goggles Manuel has. Kelly and Billy just lost some dear friends! How convenient he just happens to have them  no matter what!). However  for some strange reason Kelly likes this girl hitting Manuel and starts to hate Billy for being jealous. OK  Billy is overreacting  thats for sure  but Kelly isn't doing much to convince him either. She spends more time with Juan P and even wants him to sleep with them since hes been so nice (and even though Manuel yelled at her and calling her things for asking him some intimate questions. But Kelly is SO forgiving...). Yeah right. And then she starts to have sex with this Juan P. It should be said that Kelly and Billy seems to have a working relationship before this island incident  at least  they have intimate sex on the boat and talks like people do when they like each other. Now  you can think that this scenario is possible. But for real  is it? Are you cheating your husband after two days on a coconut island just because hes jealous and acts like a drunk in the bar? (i wouldn't disagree if there relationship was really bad but the director doesn't give much hints if thats the case). For Christ sake  Juan P hasn't really shown himself being a good person. Catching some fish and built a wood house to get into someones panties  is that showing a good side? Not trying to befriend Kellys husband in anyway (which would be very simple by letting them be alone most of the island-time  simply be respect) He doesn't care about their relationship (and Kelly cant figure that one out)  he just want to have sex with Kelly. Kellys character is just not trustworthy (if she was stranded with Billy and another attractive girl  wouldn't she be upset or what?!). Or maybe she is? Billy Zane plays a not very nice person  and Juan P isn't actually much better if you really think about it. And poor Kelly is so confused  and believes having sex with Juan P will solve everything because her husband is so strange and so aggressive towards poor Juan P? So... for all of you who reads this... What do you think about it? If you where the Kelly character  would you consider cheating on your husband  knowing one day you'll be back in real life  and all of a sudden Billys maybe not that horrible person after all. Hes just too jealous. And if you where Billys character  what do you say  is he totally wrong in his behavior? And Juan P character what do you guys really think of him. One thing is for sure. Manuels exist! Ps... The voodoo thing is so totally wrong here! What the heck was that about?! Seriously! Anyone tell me?\n",

However  despite the different costumes  it's still a Hercules movie with the usual stilted dialog  haphazard dubbing  and cardboard characters. On the other hand  there's lots of action  the pace rarely flags  and Reeves gets to do yet another one of those scenes where he's stripped to the waist  bound with ropes  and given a vigorous whipping which  needless to say  has little effect on his defiant character.\n",

      "I first saw this when it came out in the theater. Though only 13 at the time  I was an avid reader of hard science science fiction stories. The technical gaffes of the film are burned into my memory.  Some of the following may have significant spoilers.  Even as a youngster  I knew the premise is silly. The rocket takes off for a lunar mission  in a cosmos where there is always a gravitational effect on the crew (though loose objects float as in zero gravity) and because of that  the cabin (the area with the controls  whatever they called it) was gyrostabalized to maintain the correct orientation (so that when they landed  why didn't they land standing on their heads?) and where  at least in near-earth space  the rocket engines had to be running continually -- with propellant combusting away without an oxidizer. When the engines quit  the rocket stopped _dead_ in space  and couldn't start going until a PhD chemist determined it needed at a little oxidizer. This time  the rocket recalled it had momentum  and the next thing our heroes know they're near Mars (even a 13-year-old nerd knew such a minimum-energy trip would take over 200 days).  They land  find the air was breathable (though at the time scientific data revealed that the pressure  even if the atmosphere were pure oxygen  would be too low to do any good). They decide to camp outside the ship  and even build a campfire. They come armed  even though they were supposedly going to the Moon  where firearms wouldn't be needed.  They get a sight of a collapsed civilization  encounter stray martians who look just like people  develop an anti nuclear war philosophy  and those who survive try to get back to the home planet  and die in the attempt by crashing on the Earth! To do that would require such a long orbital period  they'd have died of starvation long before approaching their destination.  The film it preceded  Destination Moon  used real science most effectively (even though their rescue with the Oxygen Tank forgot about the moment arm from the tank's center of gravity to the output nozzle). This film showed woeful ignorance of even the most basic science. Only the most technologically illiterate should think of it as a science fiction film: it's on a par with the old Flash Gordon serials where their rocketships took off from their bellies and climbed in spirals  and whose engines were always on.  The story on this one I considered banal  and I can recommend this only as a film to be shown to students for them to pick out technical gaffes.\n",

      "this movie is about people living at a trailerpark. later in the movie it gets obvious that those people are out-of-work comedians  mainly old males. well  more or less they sit around the whole movie and talk about f***ing. but never there is any action  just those people talking. in the beginning I thought it's some cool perverted redneck-stuff  but after a while it got boring. I mean  how many versions can you think of saying f***ing  d**k & c**t? for sure  this can be funny - for half an hour maybe  not 80 minutes. but it was funny to watch those people trying to act. I'm pretty sure that they often were reading their text on some sheet when playing. but it does not disturb the movie  it's cool like this. because those individuals seem so poor  f***ed-up  crestfallen a***oles that the style totally fits. their wooden  helpless reading of the texts makes quite good atmosphere  I fell in love with the characters a little.  ***SPOILER AHEAD*** later in the movie the f***ers do some comedy-shows (rhymes about f***ing) with just themselves as audience and imagined applause. then one gets an eviction-advice and so they decide to defend the trailer park and enter their roofs - armed with some weapons. then they got shoot. fin. sounds like action  but it's not. just some trashy home-camera takes. ***SPOILER END***  but the movie is totally consequent in it's style and I'm pretty sure it's just what the movie-maker wanted to have. it's the portrait of those f**k-ups in an groggy home-camera style with characters who can not act but seem interesting personalities so they are nice to watch. but the texts about - you know what - the whole time get boring after a while.  pretty young director who also seems an interesting person  as he played some teenager-stuff in popular movies/TV-series but now got in more horror-movies which is more his cup of tea I guess. and this  his first direction-effort will be distributed by troma now. don't know anything about a release  I got this one as an advance screener from this years cannes which says for bootlegging purposes only.\n",

      "Wow  Jeez  I don't even know where to begin commenting on this thing they called a movie. I seriously don't know what the hell David Bradley began smoking after making Hard Justice  which in my opinion  was quite a good movie after the American Ninja features. I hadn't seen any of this guy's latter movies after Cyborg Cop. Lucky I saw them on Amazon for like 5 pounds each and I can safely say the following: if I had thrown down the drain the 5 pounds I spent on Total Reality  Crisis and Expect to Die  I would have ended up happier than having to sit through the 90 minutes that each of them lasted. My God  how the HECK can anybody label these as movies ??? And why do action/martial arts actors fall knee-deep into the smelliest horse-dung when they've like reached their peak?? I mean  David Bradley's no Oscar deserver but his first movies were pretty entertaining. Tough  cool guy with pretty good martial expertise who delivered corny lines but at least entertained action and martial arts fans to a certain extent. But I seriously would love to know what went through this guy's head after making Hard Justice. His final 3 movies have to frankly be the WORST I have ever had to sit through. As I mentioned before  I'd love to get my money back on the 3 DVDs I bought. Crisis was the epitome of sleepiness  Total Reality was harsh but this Expect to Die is just utter nonsense. I bet the director was either mega-stoned when he made this or he was just taking the pee out of every David Bradley fan who would sit through this heap of crap. The plot circles around a doctor (Bradley) who develops some type of Virtual Reality game in which he's just killing different people off one by one. Sorry but I just couldn't take this guy seriously playing a baddie with that posh hair-do  glasses and gray slacks and doing absolutely NO physical fighting whatsoever (frankly  his best asset). The film is even worse than any of those Saturday afternoon B-movies because the acting is laughable  the directing is horrendous and the few fights in the movie  well  what can I say... The actors look like they're training with their gym buddy. We get a dumb muscular cop who starts to show off his fighting stuff like one hour into the movie and fails heavily... a french hairy version of Van Damme who just can't fight  act or speak to save his freaking life and Bradley  the supposed protagonist  playing the evil doctor who I was really happy for when he stopped making this type of expendable rubbish. I even reckon he didn't throw a kick in this movie probably due to his heart condition already playing up on him. For a B-actor  I must admit I really liked this guy  his style  physique  fighting skills... But I'm really  really glad he stopped acting after this monstrosity because I honestly wouldn't have been able to sit through another ninety minutes of pee-taking material like this one. Avoid at all costs even if you're family of David Bradley  you'll be glad you did  word.\n",

      "As a massive fan of DM  it goes without saying that I have seen this film numerous times. However  I watch it purely for the concert footage...the rest of the film is  um  pretty dreadful  sad to say.  Famed rock music film director DA Pennebaker followed Mode around on their late 80s Music For The Masses tour  which promoted the superb album of the same name. The title 101 derives mostly from the fact that the concert material included is from the 101st and final concert of the tour at the Pasadena Bowl  but is also a reference to the movie being a 'beginners course' on the band and how it ticks ie Depeche Mode 101. Amidst footage of the quartet playing live and exploring America is a second story thread covering a group of DM fans who've won a competition to meet the band  go on the tour in their own coach bus and attend the finale gig.  Now  as I said above  the concert footage is great. Mode are here on top of their form as stadium rock gods  which was a somewhat unusual achievement for an electrorock band back in the late 80s. Though the film catches the band before they recorded their 1990 masterpiece Violator  there are still countless excellent tracks seen and heard here eg Behind The Wheel  the majestic Never Let Me Down Again  Everything Counts  Just Can't Get Enough from the Vince Clarke years  Shake The Disease and many more.  When Mode are onstage  they are brilliant. When they are not  they're  well  very boring. Nothing even vaguely of interest happens to the lads as they check out the US in the dying days of the Reagan administration. As an example  the probable highlight of the material is a visit to a country music store to buy cassettes. Not exactly thrilling stuff. I know all bands don't have to be wild and reckless idiots  but these guys make the Mormon Tabernacle Choir look like Rammstein.  The only real excitement comes from various clips centring on the band's lead singer Dave Gahan. Gahan comes across in 101 as being mildly psychotic  talking about a violent power inside himself he can't control  recalling a bizarre rage attack involving a taxi driver and so on. There's one point in the film where he throws a prima donna tantrum at some poor guy backstage - truly embarrassing. The man clearly had issues back then  which thankfully have been resolved. Songwriter Martin Gore and keyboardist Andy Fletcher are presented as very articulate  clearly massively talented  but also utterly colourless men; while the somewhat enigmatic fourth member Alan Wilder is the only one of the quartet who pulls off the rock star persona with any sort of aplomb.  And as for the 'fan tour' thread  well it's unwatchable dross. Let's not kid ourselves. Maybe it's just because it's all so *very* late 80s  but the gaggle of young devotees do little for me but raise a feeling of irritation. They are  to a person  singularly shallow and vapid people  whose antics are banal when they aren't hide-your-face cringeworthy. Let me reiterate....*nothing* happens in the footage that isn't onstage that is of any interest. Nothing. Endless scenes of kids spraying their hair  arguing pointlessly  changing their clothes  getting lost in cities on the way to gigs and finding their partners in bed with another competition winner makes me wonder just one thing - if Cure fans were this mind bendingly dull back in '88/89. The love the youngsters have for the band is something I can definitely relate to  and is at times infectiously joyous  but if what we see was the most interesting stuff out of what was filmed of them  then I'd hate to see the outtakes.  But the music is all that matters  and in this regard 101 excels. The Pasadena concert  one of their all time best gigs  makes the film worth seeing. The recent DVD edition of the movie comes with a bonus disc containing what remains of the unedited concert footage (a good 80% of the performance)  and thus makes the DVD an absolute must for fans. The audio commentary by the band (minus Wilder  who left Mode in the mid-90s) on the first disc is also  oddly  far more interesting than the film itself.  As a document of the boys from Basildon during their amphitheatre idol period  Depeche Mode 101 is invaluable. But if you're looking for excitement  you're better off getting the accompanying double live album (now available in Super Audio CD format).\n",

      "It took me a few years to hunt down this title  a major staple of my childhood. Almost every trip to the video shop I'd pick out Space Raiders and watch it three times every time my mother rented it for me. It was  I suppose  my Star Wars.  It's a shame then that it's such a stinker. My memories were so hazy that it offered nothing in terms of nostalgia so I had to take it at face value. A crew of space pirates accidentally kidnap a pretty annoying little kid and spend the rest of the movie trying to get him home.  Aimed squarely at the under-tens it's got unwelcome slapstick  very shoddy costumes and make-up  recycled special effects  wobbly sets and poor acting. But even with the unintentional comedy it's no fun to see it as an adult  where I can pick out not just the technical faults but wonder at how spectacularly the writer and director managed to botch an endless stream of no-brainer fun/powerful moments that have been seen in a million other sci-fi movies and in the hands of anyone remotely competent should have been successful.  I imagine as a kid I probably found it quite empowering - there are lots of I can't do this  I'm just a kid Sure you can kiddo  you just have to try!-type exchanges; the kid drinks beer  etc.  but even by low budget 1983 sci-fi standards this one's pretty awful  with a real snoozer of a finale.\n",

      "So after the initial disappointment of the first Final Fantasy movie  which seemed to bare next to no resemblance to the Final Fantasy series  Final Fantasy: Advent Children has released itself to a warm reception and  now  a dedicated fanbase. And the reason for the films success is understandable as it has lush graphics  fast moving fight sequences and some cool as hell characters. However  if you haven't played FF7 then it is likely that you will not enjoy this film as it's storyline carries on from the game without previous explanation and your likely to get lost from the plot even if you have played the game. Secondly  there is no character development  without previous knowledge from the game your opinions on the characters are limited to 'cool' and 'not cool'. Of course  for FF7 fans the film is almost guaranteed to entertain  at least for nostalgic reasons  and it's cool seeing all the characters you grew to love from the game rendered in some pretty amazing computer animation. One last complaint  the film  at least in my opinion  attempted to cram too much into less than two hours and therefore the last half hour or so seems horribly rushed. If you played and enjoyed FF7 than it is a worthwhile watch  though nothing too special. If you have not played FF7 then it is best that you play it first before watching this film.\n",

      "I first rented this movie on the infamous day of September 11  2001. Since then I've seen it a number of times. My only complaint is that it's too short. Strangeland would've be a complete piece of horror art at two hours. As it stands  the running time is only an hour and a half.  Ex-Twisted Sister member Dee Snider wrote  produced and stars in this 1998 shockfest set in a small Colorado town. He plays Carleton Hendricks  a crazed sadist who has psychotic ideologies on human evolution and a love for near-death experiences. Hendricks is no pushover  he's a pumped up six-foot modern primitive. Someone who has tattooed and pierced their body to the very extreme. When he makes his first full appearance in the film  it is a truly terrifying sight.  Hendricks' main hobby in life is to share his spiritual awakenings with his kidnapped victims. He visits Internet chatrooms under the name Capt. Howdy and then invites people over to his house. They believe they're going to a party. Instead  they find themselves in a house of pain and suffering. Hendricks sows their eyes and mouths shut and tortures them by sticking blades and hooks in numerous parts of their body. If it sounds sick  it's because it is.  One of Hendrick's victims is Genevieve  the teenaged daughter of detective Michael Gage. Gage not only manages to save her  but arrests Hendricks as well. Four years later  Hendricks is released from a mental institution completely rehabilitated to the disapproval of the community. A group of rednecks led by Freddy Krueger himself  actor Robert Englund  decide to kill him. They fail and Hendricks reverts back to his old self.  The rest of the film I'll leave to you  only to say the conclusion is satisfying and will leave you in shivers. With the exception of Snider  the acting isn't too good  but it's serviceable. The direction is okay  too. There are some humorous parts in Strangeland and they are very funny. I also loved the soundtrack  it's awesome and worth buying if you love rock. Overall  this is a movie worth watching. If you love low-budget horror films with a sense of humor  check it out. You'll probably like it.\n",

      "Oh Gawd. I want to time travel back to Monogram Studios and throttle someone in their 2 room front office for this sloppy musical. It is one watt above flat-lining for 60 of its 61 minutes and then actually shows (for the one thin minute  spread in milli-second blips across the hour) that there is real life talent being badly photographed.I just don't see the point of going to some trouble to actually make this film that could easily be energetic and actually funny and allow lethargy to be the main thing on view. The weird storyline shows cranky vaudeville trouper Grace Hayes bulldozing her blowsy way into a college where her rat-bag son is rich college clown. She's gonna fix his playboy ways  no matter what.Her real life son (weird looking) Peter Hays plays her screen son. His real life wife plays her secretary. Talk about nepotism. I suspect this talent package was almost the raison d'etre for Monogram financing this back-lot musical produced by resident schlockmeister extraordinaire Sam Katzman. As with other Monogram musicals it just looks more like a reason to film recent new furniture purchases and light fittings in order to show off to other studios that Monogram Pictures are 'lavish' in their B grade ways. Have a ghastly look at SWING PARADE OF 1946 for genuine evidence of this: they just constructed this gigantic nightclub set then found an excuse to film actors and musicians running all over it. Story? None. Anyway ZIS BOOM BAH is more BAH than BOOM. Where was Gale Storm and Mantan Mooreland when Monogram really needed them? Probably standing at the boom gate of PRC Pictures wondering if it looked safe to enter there. Junior jive hepster Roland Dupree springs to life to rappety tap his teen legs around two wobbly dance numbers  especially in the 'big show' finale set in the new and expanded malt shoppe/club set. The usual crumpled curtains are loosely hanging on the back wall  and the stage set of mis matched drapery even has one dark main rag that is yanked back and forth as each amateur sequence elbows past the previous one. The chorus girls and their very plain looking partners in this finale just look like Monogram office staff borrowed (from typing and carpentry) for the morning of filming. They have absolutely no dance talent and are so ordinary on screen... ALL the girls look like they are all called Joyce. There is even a costume calamity where they wear frilly hot-pants...on one leg only. It is all so awful and crummy...and actually annoying when one more tweak up by all concerned would result in ZIS being actually FUN. The one strangely interesting thing is the dialog delivery between Grace and her son/daughter in law: it is so casually delivered that it actually works in spite of the script and logic. She has a very life like presence which is the only thing that allows the ridiculous story to be slightly compelling. The Dupree kid is the real star. He can actually do something...in spite of looking like a tubby Liberace tap dancing teen... You read that right.\n",

This anti-Bush propaganda piece masquerading as a horror film comes off like an episode of the original Batman done by Michael Moore. Political satire should be clever  this however  pulls a ten on the simpleton scale with all the style and credibility of an L. Ron Hubbard film.  In its campy  inane way  it accuses the Republicans of stealing elections  going to war for absolutely no reason and treating servicemen and women as mere cannon fodder. It even takes a swipe at the Second Amendment and religion. All that was missing was Caesar Romero as the President cackling in glee about how he orchestrated 9/11.  I guess the ending was supposed to be the we support our troops moment  but I think they would be more offended than pleased with the entire endeavor.  I'm sure the Hollywood elites are sitting in their Malbu mansions patting each other on the backs for this pithy work while the misinformed anti-war drones hail it as genius.   Time to get fitted with new tinfoil hats kids.\n",

      "This movie was dreadful. Biblically very inaccurate. Moses was 80 years old when he led the people out of Egypt  the movie has him about forty. Moses was about forty when he fled Egypt  was gone for forty years  and was with them wandering for forty years. Moses was 120 years old when he died  and was denied the privilege of crossing over to the promised land. I realize movies use a lot of poetic license as the biblical account isn't that long  but  if making a biblical movie they still need to reflect the facts known  and keep the general flavor of the main biblical character  this movie fails in this aspect  and in many others.Even though the 1956 version has its problems as well  theatrically it was much better.\n",

      "I saw the first House of the Dead and expected a root canal to be more pleasant to attend  so when it wasn't as bad as that  I was delightfully surprised.  Unfortunately  I then got my hopes up that the second one might be okay as well...and I was wrong.  Apparently I'm one of the few people who saw this movie that thinks it was bad.  I don't know whether to watch it again and force myself to see whatever all the people who gave it good reviews saw  or wonder if I saw the wrong movie.  Ed Quinn as Ellis and Emmanuelle Vaugier as Alexandra 'Nightingale' Morgan did a great job in roles that were way beneath them. They deserve to be in better movies.  The special effects were okay and some of the characters likable/hate-able and that made for a tolerable watch  but for the most part  this movie was just a waste of time.  Oh and I have to ask this because I found myself asking it aloud ALL the way through the movie...did anyone not know how to close doors behind themselves so zombies wouldn't just wander into the rooms? Only once did it happen  (zombies wandering in) and I found that a little convenient...soldiers walk into a room  leave the door wide open  pay little to no attention to same said door so the zombies can just walk in if they feel like it (with the hapless livings being cornered with no way to escape) and yet only once did zombies follow them in.  Nitpicky? Maybe but honestly...if I was fighting for my life  the last thing I'd do would be to walk into a room and leave the door wide open so zombies could swarm in and eat me.  That is really the only thing *bothered* me throughout the movie  and just the movie for the most part was a bad sequel to a not totally abominable original.\n",

The movie seemed pretty bad and I told myself to stay away but stupid me gave in and actually bought the damn thing! All the reviews and everything bad you've heard about Caddyshack II are true. The movie is simply worn of ideas and the lamest plot and jokes I've ever heard  the gopher  the acting the whole movie really is bad (Randy Quaid was funny though).

High-definition camcorders are getting cheaper all the time (although I wouldn't swear that's what was used here)  so it's open season for all the wannabe Scorseses and Tarantinos.  There is no hiding the cheapness of this stinker  and calling it a 'film' would be doing the industry a big disservice. The photography is of a standard you would expect on a family outing to the zoo. I could build me a new house with all the wooden acting. What's remarkable about that is that nobody stands out as the worst. They are all equally terrible. Like a whole bunch of Ben Afflecks. Or Steven Seagals.  What hooked me was the title. I'm a sucker for this sort of thing  like Frankenhooker  or Monsturd. Frankenhooker was pretty bad  too  but at least I got some laughs out of it  and the acting was merely bad  not awful. I can't comment on Monsturd as I've yet to get hold of a copy of it.  Anyway  I hope the people who made this didn't make any money from it. Else they might be encouraged to try it on again.

      "Unlike most reviewers here  I hated this movie  simply because the writer/director's bloated ego was in the way of an otherwise potentially interesting topic. Too many film fans equate 'EXTREME self-indulgence' to 'film GENIUS!'  but I don't buy into that cult of personality. A film should be about its subject  not its director (unless it's a Woody Allen film  of course). *SPOILER* (which is just as well  save your time...) There is nothing brilliant about of showing you the foot-long porn-star's you-know-what in the last frame- that's actually called a tacky maneuver that SCREAMS film-school hackism.   The poseur flick has achieved 'great film' status based on its indulgence and pandering to the audience  which  first and foremost  is the writer/director. But the rest of the audience should look down on the surly  brutal nature of the porn biz  too. The flick had an aloof angle to the porn industry  looking down on each and every player it could bash. No matter  just love your writer/director. Love those four-minute steadicam segments  which are supposed to show the energy of the moment  but somehow had all the verve of an off switch. Love the story- no matter how dull it is- about the gee-whiz rise and sordid fall of a porn star. But look down on it  too  of course. While the subject has the potential to be fascinating  innocence  money  degradation  beauty- your worshipful writer/director somehow managed to make it all look  again  DULL. Partly because of its run time. Here is something your auteur hero DIDN'T try: Giving the characters dimension. Or soul. Anything AT ALL to give a hoot about  aside from Genius That Paul Is  of course. But I'm not buying. I don't buy into indulgent hacks with astounding hype.   Another overlong auteurist hack piece  with fifty times more hype than quality. I know some of you agree. The rest will see likely see this indulgent flick again. Not my problem.\n",

Unfortunately  after watching it  my impression was not too good.  Its kind of a Chinatown ripoff  but the worst part is that other than Nolte  the other members of the squad didn't get enough screen time. But its a decent movie to see once I guess.

      "This is the dreary tale of the self absorbed affair between two unlikable people  one of whom is married to someone else. It ranks high on my list of most boring movies ever  and I'm a die hard romantic. My husband opted out after the first hour of its three  by which time little had transpired. The desert scenery is spectacular  with the endless sand and the sunshine on Katharine's golden hair. However  cinematography does not a brilliant film make  unless it's a National Geographic travelogue. The magnificent Saharan scenery in this ill conceived tale is like putting perfume on a pig.  The movie revolves around a badly burned  dying pilot named Count Laszlo de Almasy  who is left in the care of a Canadian army nurse  Hana  during World War II Italy. He appears to remember little of his life but through a book in his possession  his story is VERY SLOWLY revealed  with the help of a man from his past named Caravaggio  who mysteriously appears at his deathbed. Almasy was a Hungarian cartographer employed by the Royal Geographical Society to chart the Sahara Desert. He entered into an affair with the wife  Katherine  of a fellow explorer who proved to be a British spy. Meanwhile in the present  Laszlo's nurse has her own affair with a Sikh nicknamed Kip  who is involved in the dangerous work of disarming mines.  My quarrels with this movie are many  length and tedium for starters. I don't fault the acting in particular  it simply isn't a good story. Caravaggio seems unnecessary  his connection to Almasy sketchy. He provides a torture scene but appears to serve no essential purpose in the film.  The core problem is that the two parties of this affair  Almasy and Katharine  are woefully unsympathetic characters  shallow and dull. They simply aren't very nice  thus there is no one to cheer for. Almasy is cool  aloof  haughty  and eventually disgustingly possessive of another man's wife. Katharine is likewise detached and nasty  not to mention having a deplorable lack of guilt or feeling whatsoever for her imperfect but loving husband...apart from managing one minuscule tear at the corner of her eye when he dies.   This is a tale of LUST rather than love  with such pearls as 'I can still taste you'. Almasy ridiculously vocalizes to a colleague his erotic obsession with the indentation in his beloved's neck  surely more indicative of a focus on Katharine's body. The victim of this unrepentant adultery is the hapless husband  Geoffrey  who is treated as little more than an unpleasant nuisance. It's all quite sordid and disgusting  Katharine's charade of feeling faint so that these lovers can indulge in their much vaunted unbridled passion  all as Silent Night is being sung in the background. I'm not sure whether the intent was to contrast the carol's purity with their selfish lust  but I definitely was not impressed by the sacrilegious undertone. We have full frontal nudity with Katharine  but their sex scenes come across as cold  selfish  lustful  and sometimes downright hateful...not warm  loving  giving  nor even truly passionate. If either of these two feels any emotion for the other  it is a totally selfish one and definitely NOT love  as I define the word.  Almasy's return to the Cave of the Swimmers to retrieve the body of his beloved comes across as contrived rather than moving. Katharine must have expired only moments earlier as she shows excellent colour and barely appears dozing  not at all corpse like. Of course this is all for dramatic effect  as the romantics watching this tale (normally I'd be one of them) would not appreciate a decaying  putrid corpse. In order to retrieve his adulterous lover's body  he has betrayed his comrades & the Allies by giving his maps to the Nazis  the English being cast as the villains of the piece. Regardless of whether or not he's keeping his final promise to Katharine  his traitorous act is not something I admire much.   Kip seems a pleasant fellow and Hana generally likable  but their romance is not in the least engaging  merely a brief wartime fling with the parties indicating little trauma upon parting. Moving back and forth between the two settings (past Sahara Desert and present Italy) proved distracting and unpleasant but really  both stories were dull as dishwater. The only spark of interest in the whole picture was Kip's tense mine disarming scene.  Not being totally heartless  I did have some sympathy for the current Almasy's severely burned and dying state. However  perhaps my major complaint with this film is the euthanasia at the end when Hana obliges her patient by giving him a morphine overdose. We are supposed to feel that this is justified and morally acceptable because she obviously has affection for Almasy  cries while she is preparing the deadly syringe  and reads aloud from his allegedly passionate Herodotus book to console him as he's dying.   The amazing director David Lean's masterpieces should not be insulted by comparison with this pathetic  immoral tale. Yes  Lawrence of Arabia also has a desert  but in Lean films (Doctor Zhivago  Brief Encounter)  those engaging in affairs are sympathetic characters exhibiting admirable restraint  guilt  and some regard for the betrayed spouse  as opposed to the total self absorption of this pair. In Ryan's Daughter  the cuckold husband displays touching loyalty and forgiveness.   This movie is a supposedly intellectual  enormously over rated bit of boring and disgusting drivel that unfortunately passes itself off as a great love story. Its Best Picture Oscar does not speak well for the Academy. For those who wonder why people are so hard on this movie  the answer is simple. It's awful.\n",

There is nothing interesting about this romance  it is not exciting  it is not fun  they don't even seem to care for each other at all  its more like the writers and directors wanted an interracial thing going on. Why this is so popular in media today? It is social programming and will lead to no good  there is always tension when too many people want the same thing. This show is not worth the 20 bucks for the season  its a waste of time and harmful to society. At least when they use TV shows to sell products they are more discreet  selling whatever agenda here is quite obvious  and without clear thinking some may feel wrong to oppose it  but some of us know better.\n",

      "Mario Racocevic from Europe is the only user who has posted a comment so far and covers the major points to the film.Yet again another difficult film to purchase in the UK.I had to go through Midnight Video who have a Swedish branch.I went to the post office and bought by mail order this and a similar title at only SKR30 a title.  This film goes under many a.k.a's depending on when and where it is marketed.I had previously purchased The Bloodsucker leads the Dance (which you will find if you search on Imdb under people and input Krista Nell).The actor who plays the Count on his private island in the latter film had his words dubbed from Italian into English by an actor with an unmistakably mournful and rather tired sounding voice.I smiled when I heard this same voice dubbing on the English soundtrack as the police inspector who is investigating the murder of the prostitute killed in the copse in the subject film.My choice of course was to see another outing by the delicious Krista Nell.  There are quite a few rather inconsequential sub plots in the movie involving blackmail/extortion  sleazy affairs with girlfriends' mothers  a motor cycle chase resulting in a gangland hit  a gangrape by a client's motorcycle friends  sleazy photography  cross dressing by transvestites etc. which give a flavour to this film summarised in a word - SLEAZE  (but artistic sleaze).The aforementioned contributor liked this film but the lowly rating suggests other Imdb fans did not albeit without explaining their wheres and whyfores.Personally I thought there were too many subplots and not enough put into the main story and the relationship of these subordinate characters to the central plot and the development of their screen characters.Also a professional film editor was sorely needed as some of the scenes appeared to last far too long  having made their point  so that the film appeared to drag in places; e.g. the scene of the dancing transvestite.Krista Nell appears in one fruity scene with a client but this too is but a vignette and I was left wanting more from her  the director and the screenplay.  I love the political incorrectness shown in older films (this is 30 years from its making) e.g. smoking in offices and the way some characters react to each other in the office!I would suggest 4/10 as a more realistic rating and I have awarded it as such.\n",

      "An insult to both poker and cinema  this movie manages to make the most dynamic  brilliant  and fascinating figure in poker history into an utter bore. Still a fun film to make jokes about  from the lame gangster movie clichés of the first half to the incomprehensible nonsense of that second hour. Hilariously  Stu Ungar wins all three of his World Series titles without playing a single hand on screen. His infamous dealer abuse? 1 scene. His coke habit? 1 scene. His incredible memory? 0 scenes. They couldn't even get any real poker players. What did they cover? A lot of high angle shots from inside a house in the suburbs. Oh  and a montage of Stu waking up every day and shopping for meat which doesn't come anywhere close to making sense. Why do I care so much about this little Sopranos summer camp trying to cash in on the poker craze? Because I think there's still a great film to be made about Stu Ungar waiting for someone willing to do it right.\n",

      "Susan Slept Here turned out to be Dick Powell's swan song as a performer on the big screen. Of course he directed some more films and appeared frequently on television until he died. It's a pity he didn't go out with his performance in The Bad and the Beautiful.  Frank Tashlin has done so many better films  I'm still not sure whatever possessed him to do this one. The premise is absolutely laughable.   Dick Powell is a screenwriter who's looking to do more serious stuff than the fluff he's been writing. He had an idea for a film on juvenile delinquency so two friendly cops in Herb Vigran and Horace McMahon deposit 17 year old Debbie Reynolds on his doorstep. She's not a really bad kid and they don't want to put her in the system. So they give her to Dick Powell at Christmas time.  I mean is there anyone out there who doesn't see a problem? The term jailbait comes immediately to mind. Additionally Powell has a girlfriend  the young and sexy Anne Francis. Why Debbie Reynolds is any competition here is beyond me.  Susan Slept Here got one Oscar nomination. The song Hold My Hand  sung by Don Cornell in the background  was nominated for best song  but lost to Secret Love.   Powell and Reynolds do have some funny moments together and Alvy Moore as Powell's factotum and Les Tremayne as his lawyer also get a few laughs.   But it's not enough.\n",

The acting in the film is average and a bit hammy  especially by the family of cannibals  one sequence comes to mind when Jupiter is ranting and raving to the burnt corpse  speaking right into the camera. Its one of those performances where you just cringe and feel bad for that poor actor. Its also evidence of some of the worst editing I've seen  theres a terrible jump cut right in the middle of his speech. There are a few creepy moments though  and at times the music works well...but overall the film isnt that great and I dont know why people think Wes Craven is that great of a director. Thus far he hasn't showed me anything that I believe to be brilliant  the only thing that improved with Cravens films  production to prodution was his budget.\n",

      "Atmosphere and droll dialog don't redeem this overrated classic. Boyer is a French thief hiding in the Casbah of Algiers while the police try to figure out how to get him out. Meanwhile  he falls for Lamarr and tries to find a way to escape. The film is slow to get started and never really goes anywhere. Reminiscent of Casablanca in some ways  it's completely lacking any larger theme than the wanted man seducing a good woman. It's all talk-talk-talk  with endless scenes of Boyer swaggering among his idiot cohorts and Boyer wooing Lamarr in the shadows. Personally  I didn't care for Boyer's character for a minute  so the tension was utterly nonexistent.  Stock 1930s character actors stumble thru the mushy plot as Boyer's henchmen--guys who clearly do not belong in Algiers. Sigrid Gurie is the wildly-overacting jealous girlfriend of Boyer. His brazen womanizing in front of her doesn't bode well for any future he might have with Lamarr.  Especially bad is a long sequence in which an underling comes to tell Boyer how another henchman was captured. It sounds exciting... too bad we didn't see it for ourselves. The ending is completely anticlimactic and seems to be remarkable only because it is not a Hollywood happy ending; that doesn't stop it from being sappy.\n",

I can't understand how the average rating for this movie is over 6 out of 10. I gave the first 2 movies 8 out of 10. They were thought provoking and beautifully done. I gave this movie a rating of 1. If a 0 or negative number was available  I would have given it that rating instead. What a total waste of time it was watching this movie.

Don't take my word for it  watch it yourself. Be sure to see the first two movies before this one.

A male chauvinistic glorification of sexual conquest. The climax is predictable (having been used ad nauseum in several other films).

      "What a disappointment! I've enjoyed the Jon Cleary books about Scobie Malone  but there's little resemblance between him and the cinematic Malone. In the books he's a city detective  who is devoted to his wife and doesn't get involved in fisticuffs. For the film the character has been spiced up  into an outback copper who uses his fists and isn't averse to jumping into bed with a gorgeous girl  though quite what she and the film's other sex interest see in him I don't know; Taylor was 39 at the time and his face was getting puffy.  But his character's stamina is remarkable; he flies in from Australia  apparently goes straight to the Commissioner's house (rather unwisely seeking to arrest him during a black-tie reception)  saves him from assassination (getting into a fight in the process)  goes to a casino with one girl  leaves with another and takes her to bed. So much for jet lag! On the way back to the Commissioner's house (showing a good knowledge of London back streets)  he gets beaten up by the baddies  but is still first down to breakfast! It's also remarkable that the commissioner's limo has its windscreen and headlights miraculously repaired within minutes of the assassination attempt and that one character has a touching faith in the precise timekeeping of a clock-activated bomb.  The best thing is Joseph the Butler's disdain for the uncouth Malone. And at least the film avoids being a London travelogue  though some scenes take place during the Wimbledon tennis week.\n",

      "Olivier Assayas' film stars Asia Argento as a woman who had a relationship with Michael Madsen. Madsen is a business man who's in financial trouble. In desperation he is going to sell his share of a business to a company called Golden Eagle  a company from the Far East. As Madsen begins his moves away from his company Asia Argento returns to his life. The pair had a torrid love affair that included her doing business favors for Madsen (with said Golden Eagle). Once Argento enters the film the film follows her as we see the tangled web she's woven and how the complications spin dangerously and violently out of control.  I'm not a fan. Actually I was quite bored as the film seems to go from pillar to post for much of the first hour during which I kept wondering what the point was other than to provide a meaty role for Argento. Argento  daughter of director Dario Argento and a director in her own right  is a unique actress. At times stunningly good  she is more often then not going to give you a quirky off beat portrayal of a damaged human being. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I don't think it completely works here mostly because the script is too complicated to support it. I didn't care what was going on so her wounded girl just rubbed me the wrong way(she seemed more nut job than anything else). I'm not blaming the actors but writer/director Assayas who has once again constructed a complicated tale with the sort of parts actors love to tackle  but which leave audiences scratching their heads because they they don't really work.

It would appear that all that this film shares with the novel is the same title. We have no suspense  no sense of foreboding of mystery  no chance to really empathize with the main characters. We spend the entire duration (or at least I did) waiting for Charlotte Rampling to shed her clothing (for Charlotte  this appears to take a remarkably long time!). Still  a glimpse of Charlotte Rampling´s tits really can´t save this disastrous film. MacLean has once again been kicked into the gutter to endure the sniping of those bitter hacks and nit-pickers who would appear to blame him for all the ills that befall attempted filming of his books. Poor old Alistair must have crawled into a corner and whimpered when this one came out. At least Bear Island - which also uses the Maclean name but apparently none of his novel - was a LITTLE exciting. The excitement here is in waiting for the final credits.\n",

You know  I saw a lot of bad movies in my life  but after watching this one  i only had two questions: 1) Is this was just a parody (spoof)   2) How could people create such a thing!?   If You never saw this film  than you REALLY don't know what is a REALLY bad film. I mean BAD. The script - Are you kidding my? Acting is so horrible that i thing the actors where just having fun in this movie. I know  this is B movie  but come on?? Is this have to be a reason to be such a garbage??   Oh! And what an ending!!! A must miss ending! Just when you thing that this is the worst thing you have ever saw  wait until the ending - because THAT kind of ending You have NEVER saw before (and I hope You will never see).   Awoid this movie at any cost  and don't say i didn't warn you...\n",

      "Solo is an action movie about a Terminator-like android that is constructed and trained for the military. When a flaw is discovered  he is issued to be deprogrammed. Rather than face death  he chooses to flee into the jungles of Central America  where he takes refuge in a village. The military chases him into there  leading into a big action feast.  Mario Van Peebles does a decent performance the android. His movements and gestures look mechanical enough to get the job done. Actual scientific realism is abandoned in order to make a good action hero. And it works out; the action scenes aren't that spectacular  but they aren't all too bad either. The acting from the other characters is pretty bad  but I was not expecting anything too good. The special effects were decent as well.  Solo is decent as an action flick  but very forgettable. It lacks the substance that most movies possess. But if you just want to pass a couple hours without much thinking  this will get the job done.\n",

      "Lame rip-off of THE QUATERMASS XPERIMENT (1955): the first half is deadly dull  even dreary - but the latter stages improve considerably with the scenes involving the rampaging 'monster'. In the accompanying featurette (a rather dry affair at a mere 9 minutes  when compared to the ones created for the other titles in Criterion's Monsters & Madmen set)  director Day - who admits to not being a fan of the sci-fi genre - tries to justify the film's shortcomings by saying that he had a zero-budget to work with (where all the outer space scenes were composed of stock footage!)...and I'd have been inclined to be more lenient with the film had I not recently watched CALTIKI  THE IMMORTAL MONSTER (1959) - a similar (and similarly threadbare) but far more stylish venture from Italy!   Bill Edwards as the cocky but unlucky astronaut - obsessed with achieving the titular feat - is positively boring at first  but he eventually manages to garner audience sympathy when his physical features are deformed and the character develops a taste for blood! Marshall Thompson as his commanding officer and elder brother is O.K. as a leaner Glenn Ford type; he had previously starred in FIEND WITHOUT A FACE (1958)  another (and more successful) Richard Gordon-produced sci-fi which  incidentally  is also available on DVD through Criterion. Italian starlet Marla Landi  struggling with the English language  makes for an inadequate female lead; even her input in the featurette proves to be of little lasting value!   The Audio Commentary is yet another enjoyable Tom Weaver/Richard Gordon track where  among many things  the fact that FIRST MAN INTO SPACE was intended as a double-feature with CORRIDORS OF BLOOD (1958) is brought up - but it was eventually put out as a standalone release  so as to exploit the topical news value of the current space race; it's also mentioned that the monster dialogue was actually dubbed by Bonar Colleano (who  tragically  died in a traffic accident prior to the film's release!). Weaver even recalls a couple of anecdotes from the time when he was involved in the production of the DVD featurette shot by  of all people  ex-cult-ish film-maker Norman J. Warren: Landi  who by then had become a lady of title  was still ready to help out in carrying the equipment necessary to film the interview down several flights of stairs!; Edwards was supposed to have contributed to the featurette but  once in London  he proved reluctant to co-operate with Weaver - eventually  the latter learned that the actor had been recently diagnosed with cancer and  in fact  he died in 2002!\n",

Saying the universe was created by a giant hippo cannot be disproved.

No bones of any primates are have been found in the United States or Canada. There is also a good reason why legitimate scientists don't bother studying this.

      "Well there's a few things about this movie. Everyone should see it. You see the nation of Iraq like you've never seen it covered by the media  and shot from a perspective that is hardly considered by most Americans  where the movie has its main audience. However all that glorious stuff in mind lets take a look at a few other facts of the movie. There were 150 cameras handed out to the Iraqi people most all of which view the war and subjugation of the occupying forces as a growing pain for the bettering of their nation. And in comparison to Saddam it is simply a feeble scratching at the skin. Also  Netflix as its main distributor advertised it before the fun election we just had by sending out a mass e-mail to its entire roster to see the film. Many of the  what should be labeled as opinions played out as facts listed off by the interviewed Iraqis are wrong. If one is to review the Red Cross' records of Abu Ghraib tortures it wasn't Saddam's henchmen who were being tortured it was a fine mix of a 80-90% innocent civilians and 10-20% rightfully detained people. Never was it disclosed that any of that 10-20% were Saddam's Henchmen or curfew violators. In addition the Arab world really has never listed 'Democracy' as one of their opponents  more correctly it is the USA's 6 Billion Dollars a year to Isreal  our military bases in Saudi Arabia and our interest in Oil. I agree that the media is a complete distortion  but this film shows that same distortion. I'm afraid that the Iraqi people that this film represents have been edited to speak with a Yankee voice. Yes its true that Saddam is a puke  and that his removal many see for the best. Its true that some Iraqis actually get paid a good wage. Just as its true that no Iraqi people have control of their most prized oil and US corporations do. Nor does it mention that 20 000 civilians have died due exclusively to US artillery. Still 15% of the country which once had running water and electiricity now does not. Nor does it mention that from 1993-2003 UN sanctions purposed and authored by the USA Government killed over 200 000 Iraqi civilians. Nor does it mention that Democracy in when people decide the government  not a massive war machine that sends the message  'Be killed or Obey'. I am afraid that the cutting room floor must have quite a bit of Iraqis that aren't so happy with the Occupation. Just as the vast majority of the world was not for the war. In fact the America  Britian  Spain and the rest of them are not carriers of Democracy  they turned their back to it when they saw how full their pockets could be. Hurray  Saddam is out of power  but I'm afraid that no Iraqi is yet in power. Corporations are in power  the media is in power. Read  do your own research  and don't let them blindfold you.\n",

One shouldn't make such films with horrible special effects because then people won't take it seriously. The acting and direction was also horrible. The screenplay had many plot holes and the whole film wasn't believable at all. This has to be the worst Indian film ever. The songs were also bad. The acting was bad and artificial. Need I say more.

      "I went to see this 3 nights ago here in Cork  Ireland. It was the world premiere of it  in the tiny cinema in the Triskel Arts Centre as part of the Cork Film Festival.  I found Strange Fruit to be an excellent movie. It is a bit rough around the edges  but for a low-budget movie that is to be expected! In general the acting (particularly from the main lead Kent Faulcon) is wonderful  the cinematography and direction excellent  and the script hugely entertaining and thought-provoking  with some nice set-ups and witty dialogue.  The ending was a bit sudden  with no conclusion given to characters and events once the finale came to its gripping end ... but perhaps that's what the filmmakers were going for? It certainly did make the movie more unsettling. I did like the fact that the main character never came to terms with his mother on screen: it leaves you wondering whether or not he ever will  as in real-life sometimes these things are never settled. This was a good choice  to leave it unresolved rather than sentimentally wrapping it up!  Taut and suspenseful throughout  Strange Fruit is a hugely ambitious debut and I have high hopes for what the writer/director Kyle Schickner will unleash next. He - and his colleagues - are a talent worth watching.  I hope Strange Fruit gets a wider release soon  as more people deserve to see this movie  an above-average thriller with some original and insightful twists on homophobia and racism in America's Deep South.  Highly Recommended: 7/10\n",

      "An hulking alien beastie crash-lands on Earth and soon wrecks havoc upon the populace first using his laser ray gun to dissolve into dust almost every human he catches sight off (that is when his aim isn't terribly off) and later his bare claws with which he likes to rip out and eat human spleen!   All in all  it's pretty silly stuff. I do have to give it some points for being somewhat fun at times. I actually enjoyed the mindless ray gun battle at the beginning and some of the later over the top gore effects. However it doesn't help when the monster provides the movie's only truly entertaining moments and he isn't on screen for a large portion of the film's running time. The acting throughout this is just plain awful and amateurish and our lead hero Sheriff Cinder is much too unattractive to be bagging the film's hottest chick. I also have to take off points for blatantly copying THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD (1951) on several occasions. When the monster isn't on a rampage  NIGHTBEAST is far too dull and eventually his attacks become so repetitive and predictable even they become less fun. Watch this one back to back with the 1951 THING and see the difference characterization  attention to plot and detail and creating suspense makes to a monster on the loose movie.\n",

      "Randy Bowers (John Wayne) comes upon the Half Way House at just the right time to take a break from the trail  and discovers a slew of dead bodies inside  among them a man he was supposed to deliver a message to - Ed Rogers  proprietor of the establishment. He's observed by the dead man's niece Sally (Alberta Vaughn)  from behind a hidden room  where she remained unobserved during the carnage.  Randy Rides Alone was directed by Harry Fraser. He uses a filming technique here as in other of his films  where he fast forwards the action from one location to another  usually involving a rider on a horse. It's pretty well done and appears quite innovative in these 1930's era Lone Star Westerns.  Pre-Gabby George Hayes is on hand  sans whiskers  and this is the first time I've seen him as a villain. In fact it took a few scenes to realize it was him in a dual role  first as hunchbacked businessman Matt the Mute  communicating via pencil and paper  only to turn into Marvin Black  leader of a gang of outlaws. Black's gang was responsible for the murders at Half Way House  in an attempt to coerce Sally into selling out to Matt/Marvin. Another staple player is here as well  Yakima Canutt as a Black henchman named Spike. Interestingly  Yakima portrayed a villain named Sam Black in another Fraser/Wayne oater  Neath the Arizona Skies.  There's a fair amount of time-killing horseback riding back and forth between Black's Gang and the Sheriff's posse  as John Wayne's character maneuvers to expose the bad guys. In the end  he saves the day by securing Sally Rogers' thirty thousand dollars  at the expense of destroying the Half Way House  where he exchanges some sticks of dynamite for the loot in a safe. Greedy Marvin Black attempts to open it with his six-shooter  and the explosion is a fitting end for the villain. In his best Aw shucks attitude  John Wayne falls under the spell of the pretty Sally Rogers  and alas  Randy rides alone no more!\n",

      "I went to see this film because it was recommended to my wife and she wanted to go.  We were both trying to look at our watches well before the film ended  in order to see how much more we had to endure. Two hours and six minutes long  it is. It's divided roughly equally between battle scenes (about a dozen of them  all more or less interchangeable)  and plot development.  One would have thought that with the subject being the son of a minor tribal chief who conquers half the world  plotting would have been relatively easy. There's a fair bit of raw material there from which to make a pretty good story. However the writers fluffed it completely. We get no real history. We get instead a Hollywood version of history.  What sustains young Temudjin through his long -- almost endless  actually  or so they seem to the viewer -- tribulations? Why  the love of a good woman  of course.  How does he get out of prison? Well  an old monk  who recognizes his innate goodness and greatness  sets out across the continent to take to this good woman a talisman that symbolises Temudjin's love for her  dropping dead just close enough to her for her to find him as he lies there  talisman in his hand. And of course she then goes and  having (inexplicably) become rich and powerful  rescues him.  How does he escape from the shackles? Well  he goes off to the shrine of the great wolf-god Tengri (or some such name) and Tengri sets him free by magic. Yeah  right.  Why does he want to become ruler of the Mongols? The wolf-god again  apparently. Off goes Temudjin to ask for guidance  and -- surprise! surprise! -- he gets it. Laws  he says to himself. What the Mongols need are laws. Good  simple ones. Golly  it was impressive.  And then finally  how does he win the decisive battle against his rival's more powerful forces? Better tactics  certainly  but also through the aid of the good old wolf-god again  who sends a storm at the height of the battle. All the troops cower as the thunder rolls and the lightning flashes (Mongols are scared of thunder  you see) -- but not our Temudjin. The troops  completely wowed by his bravery  acclaim him king!   I don't know what induces people to keep producing this kind of garbage. The funny thing is it's interspersed with all sorts of gritty realism: lots of slurping of milk  dirt and violence. It's as if the producers of this movie wanted to get the trivial things right so that viewers wouldn't notice how infantile some of the big stuff is.  There's heaps of violence in graphic close-up: slashings  impalings  spouts of blood  sprays of blood  clouds of blood -- the blood guys had a great time  actually. Despite the realism  it's impossible to take seriously.  I must mention the ludicrous CGI final battle scene. How anyone can think these things look realistic is beyond me. They don't. Oh  and it's all shot in the standard Hollywood style -- breathtaking panoramas for the spectacular scenery  and the super-close-up Stedicam stuff for the battle scenes. And the standard Dolby super-sound-effects of whumps and thumps and the constant low-frequency hum to sustain tension.  Tedious.  Avoid.\n",

      "This movie starts at A and never quite reaches B. Its title promises far more than the film delivers. It's superficial and filled with the usual cliches of a story in which a guy questions his sexuality. The people are agreeable  even the obligatory flamboyant type. The lead (Kevin McKidd) overacts insofar as there's a reason for him to act at all. Simon Callow  playing a horny straight  is always worth watching  and he's by far the only reason to stay with the movie. However  the rubbish about his men's group meditations or whatever they are grows extremely tiresome in short order. They seem to have been thrown into the movie's mild mix in a misguided effort to vary the setting and non-stop inaction. The same comment applies to a really odd and unconvincing camping trip. Don't worry about pausing the tape so you can get a snack. Let the thing run; you won't miss anything. Hugo Weaving's character is superfluous. He appears in a sequence with one of the lesser leads and doesn't even meet the rest at all. The outcome of that sequence isn't explained  and Hugo's real estate dealings have nothing to do with the story. The movie is a total disappointment at the end  because there is no resolution. The thing simply fades out and we're sent to the closing credits. This is an interlude with no structure.\n",

      "Ed Wood  perhaps the worst film maker of all time left us gems that are SO bad  they delight  being unintentionally funny and therefore charming and innocent.  James Lay  and his financial backers (Mom and Dad  it seems from the credits) have created in 'Dreamland' a film just as poorly made as any Ed Wood film  but lacking any charm or innocence. Dreamland simply stinks  and about the only good thing about this 90 minute waste of time is the certain knowledge that James Lay and his fellow perps will never make another picture again.  I must mention some of the dramatic lengths some of the crew took to avoid being associated with this horrible picture.

You can tell right from the start that this movie just wasn't going to measure up. It's too bad it has a title that links it to the original Christmas Vacation. It's really kind of sad. The film can't stand on it's own merits. I think too many people will view this film on the strength of the title and it does not come close to that level of comedy. Other than the title  there is very little connecting the movie to the original 'Christmas Vacation' and even less of a connection to Christmas at all. The comedy is very simplistic and the plot poor. Children might find some humor here but most adults would only get a chuckle here and there. This movie is a flop. Don't waste your time with it.\n",

      "For a while when I was in-between jobs I had a habit of watching all the late night talk shows. For a while I had a good selection: Conan  Leno  Letterman  Ferguson  Kimmel...  Until I reached the 1:30 a.m. time slot. The time between Conan and X- Files  on SciFi. And the only show on at that time was (and curiously still is) Carson Daly.  His show intrigued me at first. Youngish  casually dressed  and with the hip pedigree of an MTV host  I thought Carson would bring a younger aesthetic to late night. I couldn't have been more wrong.  He has no comedic timing. His jokes are plainly unfunny  and his monologue a painful affair of self-conscious babbling. I began to think he simply wasn't capable of delivering comedy (and I am right  he isn't)  but it became obvious over time that the writers on the show must have had it in for him. The writing was idiotic and much too overreaching and the skits screamingly bad. And towards the end of the show being in-studio  the writers had Carson drinking alcohol on the set with gusto on every show  an oblivious Carson grinning from emaciated cheek to emaciated cheek as he sloshed his way through interviews.  Zero interview skills. None. He tries to be friendly/chatty  but ends up being boorish and rude. He talks too much. He cuts off his guests. He asks them rude or embarrassing questions -- if he can find a question to ask them at all. And as someone had already pointed out  the guests literally stare at him or squirm in their seats  clearly uncomfortable.  Now the show has left the studio and looks as though it were shot on one handy cam. Even still  Carson refuses to take the hint from NBC. At one point  Carson didn't even get a camera man  he had to film himself for an episode! Wake up  Carson...that handwriting is all over the wall.  I see the show is produced by Carson. I can only imagine that is the reason it is still on the air  he pays for it himself.\n",

This ancient Latin American tribe  even preceding the Aztecs  supposedly had the most malevolent and bloodthirsty sorcerers  yet they get their asses whooped by a couple of college floozies and a one-hundred-and-seven-year old lawman with a whip! But before you get to see this  however  you have to struggle through more than 40 minutes of sheer boredom  infantile pranks and sleazy sequences that don't contain any actual sleaze. In case I haven't made myself entirely clear yet: The Dark Power is an indescribably cheesy and inept piece of 80's horror crap that still manages to be amusing because of its sheer and somewhat charming stupidity factor. Writer/director Phil Smoot's intentions were obviously admirable  but he  as well as the rest of the cast & crew  lacked the talent and financial means to deliver something even half-decent. Smoot carefully watched The Evil Dead and other similar demonic-themed movies  and somehow must have thought he could pull this off as well. The movie opens with an old Indian guy dying in his isolated countryside house; barely speaking out his last word above a whisper ",
      " Toltecs. His grandson promptly rents out house to a bunch of college chicks  including a typically 80's aerobics babe  a cute black girl and a racist redneck gal. Soon they will discover why exactly the old Indian lived like a hermit  as he was actually the guardian of an ancient Toltec burial ground. Toltec sorcerers buried themselves alive  only to emerge again thousands of years later and feed on the flesh of the living. And  honestly  is there any better tasting flesh than that of bimbos? As hinted at before already  the first half of The Dark Power is terribly lame and sleep-inducing. The clichéd pranks  the retarded dialogs and the ridiculously overlong footage of Lash LaRue swinging around his whip seem to go on forever. Then  the movie loses its last smidgen of credibility when the Toltec sorcerers emerge from the ground. Instead of menacing  they look like drugged out hard rock stars with imbecile masks and drunken gestures. Exactly ONE gory moment is worth mentioning  when a guy's lips are stretched out over his entire skull  but overall even the carnage aspect of this movie is disappointing. The only remotely worthwhile moments are utterly senseless  like when a 9-year-old kid (named Cletus!) goes joyriding with his uncle's truck or when the vulgar naked chick sips beer in the bathtub after working out. Seriously  unless you get turned on by the sight of a 1940's western veteran swinging around his whip at nothing  I'd advise to skip this film.\n",

      "The time I wasted seeing this movie  I demand back! I felt sick afterward  but not because it touched me in any way. It's pretentious  trying to get the audience to feel bad for the people involved  but I couldn't care less. The characters are soulless and stupid. You don't get an explanation for some of the scenes and it doesn't leave any thoughts afterward to come up with your own explanation. All of the students in the movie has issues  but since you don't feel for them you don't believe their problems.  If I could write better in English I'd never stop. But I can't  so  I'll stop now.

      "It's unlikely that anyone except those who adore silent films will appreciate any of the lyrical camera-work and busy (but scratchy) background score that accompanies this 1933 release. Although sound came into general use in 1928  there are no more than fifty words spoken to tell the story of a woman  unhappily married  who deserts her husband for a younger man after a romantic interlude in the woods.  The most vividly photographed scene has the jealous husband giving a lift to the young man for a ride into town  proceeding to drive normally until he realizes the man is his wife's lover. In a frenzy of jealousy  he drives at top speed toward a railroad crossing but changes his mind at the last moment  losing his nerve. It's probably the most tension-filled scene in the otherwise decidedly slow-moving and obviously contrived story.  HEDY LAMARR is given the sort of close-up treatment lavished on Marlene Dietrich by her discoverer  but her beauty had not yet been refined by the cosmeticians as they were when she was transported to Hollywood. Her performance consists mostly of looking sad and morose while mourning the loss of her marriage with only brief glimpses of a smile when she finds her true love (ARIBERT MOG)  the handsome young stud who retrieves her clothes after a nude swim.  The swimming scene is very brief  discreetly photographed  and not worth all the heat it apparently generated. The love-making scene  later on  is also artfully photographed with the sort of lyrical photography evident throughout most of the film--artfully so. More is left to the imagination with the use of symbolism--and this is the sort of thing that has others proclaiming the film is some kind of lyrical masterpiece.  Not so. It's disappointing  primitively crude in its sound portions (including the laborious symphonic music in the background) and certainly Miss Lamarr is fortunate that Louis B. Mayer saw the film and on the basis of it  gave her a career in Hollywood. He must have seen something in her work that I didn't.  It's apparent that this was conceived as a silent film with the camera doing all the work. The jarring workers scene at the conclusion goes on for too long and is a jarring intrusion where none is needed. It fails to end the film on the proper note.\n",

The set was cheap and included a terrible film called the Dark that I actually remember seeing in the theater.  The remaining 2 were equally as bad. Creatures from the Abyss being probably the worst of the bunch. Since they were all bad that isn't saying much. But its stupidity  bad acting  terrible effects and retarded storyline actually made this one a lot of fun to watch. I was rolling on the floor with each new plot development. The discovery of the abandon ship  the missing crew  the realization that there was something terribly wrong!!! It was great!!! Of course  everyone's favorite scene seems to be the sex scene. OMG!! I almost lost it!!! Between that an the monster cam  I have to say I enjoyed this film a lot.  I am a fan of bad movies so I enjoyed it but in all fairness  I did have to give the movie a 1.

      "The movie 'Heart of Darkness'  based on the 1899 book by Joseph Conrad is one with little to no detail and has an almost schizophrenic like plot line. If you have read the book then you know that little to none of the important story making scenes were put into the movie. In the book there is so much that is left up to the imagination and I feel that that is one of the part that make the book what is it. An example would be when Marlow spent timeless hours and days  even months waiting for rivets and that entire scene was left out of the movie. Again if you have read the book then you would know that this scene in the book is one that almost describes the main  theme of futility  best. Finally I feel that the movie was too cut and dry. Not enough though was put in to the original text and how that made the story what it is today.  If you have not read the book  'Heart of Darkness' (preferably  the Norton Critical Edition) then don't waist your time in renting or buying the movie. However if you have read the book then I think that you will appreciate the book a lot more if you decide to watch the movie   Eric 2007\n",

      "Ham-handed homage to honest hacking. Felt good in a soft-core way about equivalent to its mild pornography  until its vapid lack of technical and economic reality  emotional and moral sophistication became apparent.  Basically a muddled '90s remake of '85's Real Genius  with fewer and stupider geniuses  and a cynical bad ending.  Perhaps this movie would appeal to someone delighted by the thesis that becoming a billionaire is so easy it's almost accidental. Or perhaps to technical types who like seeing themselves depicted as cool and sexy. Speculating about the reasons someone might like this movie is certainly more interesting than the movie itself.

      "I bought this thing used at a video game store's clearance bin. I wanted to get that guilty feeling from watching something I've been warned is too intense to watch; I wanted the shock value. I wanted to feel guilty and bad about watching a banned film. I was very disappointed.  Cannibal Ferox does not work because it is so campy and fake. Most of the time the camera does not show you the shocking stabs  chops  slicing - you just see the aftermath. (They do show a breast hooking in detail). The special effects are just OK. Nothing here that tells you any of the violence is real. The cannibals are obviously poor people from central / south America who were dressed up as jungle savages and told to act mean. These people were obviously in on the whole picture to get a little money  or food  or both. Again...just not convincing.  However  like everyone else has said  there is some real killing of animals going on here. That is the extent of the realism. To me  that was more shocking than any gutting  chopping of scalps  or castration  and even then  the animal deaths are not that gory at all - maybe just sad.\n",

      "I wish Depardieu had been able to finish his book and see it become a dazzling success. At least he'd have wound up with something.  The film struck me as pointless  rambling  and very stylish  like some other recent French films. Not to knock it. Most recent American films are pointless and rambling and have no style whatever. We should be grateful  I suppose  for photography that evokes a European city in the midst of a wind-blown Continental winter  and for elliptical conversations that challenge our ability to understand what's up.  But there can be too much of a good thing. Golubeva is found stumbling around near the sea in the middle of the freezing night  carrying on in a bad accent about dreams and such. (There are a few sequences of dreams that include things like swimming in a river of blood. You'll love it if you're Vlad the Impaler.) Lots of people die. Catherine Deneuve dies in a suicide by motorcycle. I don't know why. Golubeva's young girl dies too  and I don't know why she dies either. She gets slapped in the face  falls to the pavement  and dies.  There is supposedly an explicit sex scene too. I'll have to take their word for it because  although it is stylishly photographed  it is stylishly photographed in almost complete darkness. Don't worry about the kiddies being shocked. They'll probably be asleep by this time anyway.  Depardieu isn't a bad actor. As we see him deteriorate from a carefully groomed handsome young man -- well  handsome except that his nose can't seem to get out of his way -- to a limping  murderous  hairy physical wreck  we feel sorry for the guy. Golubeva has a wan pretty face  with enormous half-lidded eyes and wide cheeks  like a doll. Her next movie should be a remake of Lewton's I Walked With a Zombie. Then there is this mysterious guy who leads a band. I guess it's a band. As far as I could make out  the band is made up of about a dozen drummers and a dozen musicians playing electric guitars. Every viewer will find the resultant sound interesting but uncultivated listeners fond of easy listening might not enjoy it. If you don't like the music  there's a payoff involved because the sinister composer and leader gets whacked over the head with Depardieu's walking stick.  I must say  I found it barely worth sitting through. (And it's a longie  too.) At times it was like waiting in your car at a railroad crossing while a long long freight train rumbles slowly by  sometimes stopping entirely. I wish it had had a few jokes.\n",

I think that's especially true in the United States.  Here she plays a sympathetic role. Not only that but she is also very pretty and meant to be something of a bombshell.

      "Blame Guy Ritchie. The late 90s success of Ritchie's cliché-ridden Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels triggered a series of pitiful gangster movies from which the genre never really recovered. Sadly Rise of The Footsoldier - the true story of Essex hardnut Carlton Leach - isn't likely to reverse that trend. Despite a decent lead performance from Hartnett  the film falls victim to all-too familiar East End stereotypes. They're either busy blowing someone's brains out or shagging a scantily-clad blonde.  From fearsome football hooligan in the eighties to a key figure in the criminal underworld during the nineties  Footsoldier charts Leach's rise through the ranks of thuggery. Leaving the terraces for nightclubs  Leach becomes a bouncer where he's given carte blanche to kick the crap out of anyone. Here he gets in with notorious gangland leaders Pat Tate (Fairbrass) and Tony Tucker (Stone)  and begins to realise gang-warfare ain't what it's cracked up to be.  There is fun to be had deconstructing writer-director Julian Gilbey's laughable join-the-dots yob patois  as every sentence seems to start with an  'I'm gonna fackin'",
      "' or 'You fackin'",
      "' or  on occasion  'So then I only went an' fackin'",
      "'  typically concluded with a mandatory 'caaaant!' The direction  too  smacks of sadism  especially the obvious glee Gilbey gets from filming violent scenes in close-up and  in the case of the bloody shotgun-to-the-face denouement  in triplicate.  Director Gilbey's use of the classic rise-and-fall gangster narrative isn't what will condemn Footsoldier to big screen obscurity. Nor is it the fact that half way through  the film annoyingly sidelines Leach in favour of the events culminating in the infamous shooting of Tate and Tucker. It's Gilbey's sickening appetite for scatter-shot violence that ruins the film; whether it's a brick in the face or axe in the head during a vicious attack on a train  it's all unnecessarily prolonged. Footsoldier doesn't so much pack a punch as leave you feeling violated and more importantly  robs you of two hours of your life you won't get back...\n",

      "Because that's what Hell Ride pretty much is. Larry Bishop and Tarantino partying on the Weinstein's money with the promise to deliver a movie sometime down the line. I'm all for fake boobage and booze as much as the next guy but did we really need the movie? Really there's nothing worse than the reheated second-hand leftovers of an old trend. And I'm not even talking about 70's grindhouse cinema because Hell Ride has none of the raw and unpolished feel of the era it purports to pay homage to. No  this is slick and glossy MTV Hollywood through and through. The old trend I'm talking about is the self-consciously pseudo-hip quirky cinematic world where Tarantino meets Guy Ritchie and Robert Rodriguez. All three guys were at least talented and found success for a reason. Hell Ride is just a second-hand copy  fickle and uninspired  polished to the max when it should be raw  the supercool aspect coming off forced and silly.  There's no reason for example why such a simple and utterly inane story has to be told in convoluted  back-and-forth in time fashion. It's just a post-Tarantino quirk. There's also no reason why the dialogues have to be so mind-numbingly pointless  people flapping their gums while saying NOTHING: at least when Travolta was talking about cheeseburgers in Pulp Fiction it felt fresh. Dialogues here amount to little more than pseudo-macho posturing. There's also no reason why a grating rock'n'roll guitar has to twangle aimlessly over the entire movie. Perhaps the lowest Hell Ride hits is when it tries to be quasi-existential. There's a hilarious dream/illusion scene in the desert where Bishop eats peyote and sees colours. I was half-expecting an old Indian to come out and offer nuggets of wisdom.  The only saving grace of this abysmal turd is the boobage and Vinnie Jones' monologue about his wings tattooes (and maybe some of the desert exterior shots). Lots of boobage and hot scantily clad babes. Now that's something I can get behind but a movie they don't make.

Dylan Walsh acts like a pathetic crybaby  especially at the end; Ernie Hudson is unconvincing (is it no wonder he went on to star in TV films?) and Laura Linney is nothing special. I think I can safely say the only talented actors in this film had very small roles: Joe Don Baker and Tim Curry  an always enjoyable actor (although sometimes scarred for life by constantly being reminded of his Rocky Horror Picture days).   This movie also had some other problems  including awful direction style  cheesy dialogue and a just-plain-boring plot  which was completely hashed when compared to Crichton's novel.   Not even Stan Winston's creature effects could save this movie from being a disaster. I am deeply disappointed in this movie; there was not even a campy quality to redeem itself with. It was just plain awful  cheesy  boring and ridiculous  and proves to be one of the worst Crichton book-to-film productions.  2/5 stars -  John Ulmer\n",

      "After sitting through this film  I have decided that it is one of the WORST movies I have ever seen. I knew it the moment I was subjected to three teenage girls screaming and overacting when they (OMG!) meet again  and then watching the same thing  only done by women old enough to be my mom. And that was only the first few minutes. Yeesh. So here are my comments...  1. Middle aged women + ridiculous dance moves complete with hip thrusts and over the top costumes = not a good idea.  2. Pierce Brosnan could not sing his way out of a paper bag. Nor could practically anyone else in this pile of excrement  for that matter.  3. The songs were so random. It was obvious to me that they were thrown  willy nilly  into the incredibly contrived and STUPID plot.  4. My three year old nephew could have written a better script.  I was either cringing or laughing derisively during the movie. And I normally really like movie musicals. Of course they are bound to be a bit corny...but this was ridiculous. What a waste of talent. I mean  you have great actors and actresses in this movie...I am embarrassed for them that this is now a part of their career. I regret wasting my money and time on this piece of crap.\n",

      "I clicked onto the Encore Mystery channel to wait for the movie I wanted to see  Island of Dr. Moreau. I caught only a few minutes of Shadow Conspiracy. An old man runs to meet Charlie and grabs him by the arm. Suddenly  an Assassin in a bright rain coat taps the old man in the head (with a side arm) from across the street. After waiting for C to turn around and look  the A tries to shoot C and clearly misses. C was a much easier target  the old man couldn't have run far. Duh! There is a chase and C is on an elevator A is on the roof  so he tries to shoot the cable  which is parallel to the A. He hits and severs the cable  impossible. Later  this time with a specialized rifle  the A lines up on C from maybe 50 meters  but is to stupid to notice a motorcycle coming up and taps the rider instead. How does Charlie get his parts? Does Daddy go to the producers and say Look  my kid needs work... It reminds me of his stupid Sit - Com. All the actors are good except  yup ... you got it. I usually have to endue 2 or 3 minutes of that waiting for C.S.I. to come on. Let's see  what can I do for the next hour. I know  I'll trim my toenails! Much better use of my time.\n",

      "Robert Aldrich's brutal  quasi-black comedy The Grissom Gang  a reworking of the 1948 British film No Orchids For Miss Blandish  has 1920s heiress Kim Darby kidnapped by a pack of clumsy thieves; soon  that gang is dispatched and poor Kim is then transferred into the clutches of another crooked bunch--third-rate gangster brothers with sweaty  pasty faces and a mother who looks like Buddy Ebsen in drag. At first  Darby (not very plucky  and not very smart) attempts to escape this drooling brood  but they're onto her. Eventually she just gives up trying  and therein lies the trouble with the story. Are we in the audience supposed to sympathize with her? Is her growing concern for the family half-wit supposed to be heartwarming? These are disgusting  cretinous characters  and I wanted to see as little of them as possible. But since the side-stories (the progress of the cops on the case and another one involving floozy-singer Connie Stevens) are rather dull  the director has no choice but to keep foisting those sweaty faces on us. Pretty soon  nervous Darby starts sweating too  although her scene up in the hayloft is sensitively performed and Aldrich's climactic moments are thought-provoking  if disorganized. ** from ****\n",

      "Sometimes Hallmark can get it right - like The 10th Kingdom - but many of their fantasy films plod  and this falls into the latter category. The version I saw may have been cut (a demon [?] shown in the trailer and publicity stills didn't appear)  but anything that made the movie shorter can only be a blessing.  POSSIBLE SPOILERS IF YOU ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE ORIGINAL FAIRY TALE:  Anyway  the film updates the story to the early part of the 20th Century (?)  and makes Gerda and Kay (here called Kai - being a Lexx fan  I kept expecting him to say  `The Dead do not solve puzzles') 18 year olds. Hans Christian Andersen's basic story is followed: the boy gets a shard of ice in his eye  goes bad  is taken off by the Snow Queen to solve a puzzle in her palace and Gerda goes to find him  having various adventures on the way.  As the two main characters are older than in the original  a lot of time is spent getting them together and `in love'. Unfortunately  I was never convinced that they were particularly in love  and certainly not enough in love to make sense of Gerda's quest. By the time the main plot kicks in  the movie's pace has slowed to a crawl. Alas  when Gerda begins her search for Kai  it only manages to pick up the pace to a leisurely stroll.  There are a few odd additions to the story that seem to go nowhere. At the start of the film the Snow Queen kills Gerda's mother  but no explanation for this is given. A polar bear living in the Snow Queen's palace is more than he seems (though this is possibly because the producers realised that the bear's feelings towards the Snow Queen would be OK in a Fairy Tale  but not in a modern film). Again  this is never explained. Also  hints that the Snow Queen has an erotic desire for Kai are dropped  but never followed through. The script is also full of anachronisms that really jar you out of the `fairy tale' mood.  The production looks good  though there is evidence of penny-pinching: the Snow Queen's palace is the hotel where Gerda and Kai lived covered in ice. The three main characters are played with varying degrees of success: Kai comes across as bland as does Gerda initially  but once she sets off to find Kai you warm to her. Bridget Fonda looks great as the Snow Queen  but seems to be in a different movie to everyone else.  Ultimately  the film is unsatisfying. It looks good  but drags and lacks magic.\n",

      "Ego. Seems it's the only reason this movie was made. This movie is so wrong in so many ways that it's below one's dignity to write much about it. Every character was only good at self praise and lead actors (i use this term liberally as has the director) emote in the likeness of stone. the little story  if that  fails on the basic aspects such as logic  feeling and drama. Direction leaves much to be desired. blatant flaws are all over the place (character motives aren't defined  prospective husbands are found overnight  broken car windows mend themselves among other things)  Let's face it  Himesh can't act. neither  it seems  can Hansika Motwani. In her defense  she's still a chubby child who looks older than she is thanks to tonnes of make-up. Raj Babbar Overacts and makes his little presence as fake as possible. Darshan Jariwala laughs a bit too much. The actor who plays Himesh's friend is the only natural.   a few questions do come to mind: how can such a film cost Rs.500 000 000?? where did the money go??? granted that one chase sequence was moderately well shot and Mallika Sherawat was paid an obscene Rs.15 000 000 for her 15 minute appearance and 2 songs. but the sheer stupidity of the film boggles the mind. (including 3 Mumbai auto rickshaws that show up and jump on a police car)  the good: Himesh shows courage by allowing the film to make fun of his nasal voice and trademark topi. Let's give the Devil his due: Himesh  as usual gives good music.  The bad: Direction  Story  Himesh's singing is still hard to ignore  The Ugly: Dialogs and everything else!!!  Final Word: Painful in every sense of the word! watch this movie only if you loved Subhash Ghai's Yaadein\n",

      "In addition to all the negative reviews: I was amazed to see that at the drop of a hat somewhere  somehow a CCTV-camera was summoned at a most unlikely location  to show the 'crisis'-team (''Look Maaaaa-aaam'') what was going on  notably near the Thames-barrier  where the professor is hit at full (wind)force against the head by a heavy object and subsequently lives to tell the story. Otherwise I was unable to shake off the image of some actors as portrayed in other films/programs: I said to my wife: 'Hey  that's Neil  from the Young Ones' (Nigel Planer) and 'Did they summon Hercule Poirot for help?'

To add to the disgrace of this film (shown in two parts on ITV UK recently)  ITV showed the telephone number of the Environment Agency after each episode for worried viewers  living in areas 'at risk of flooding'.

      "This is the kind of film that I am wondering why anybody would have considered doing it from the beginning. This is the kind of movie that I cannot understand how people put money in it  how the rental store can put the DVD on its shelves. This is the kind of movie I blame myself for having rented it.   There are good class-B movies  and I do not reject the genre. When they are good  they catch the interest with the action  they have characters written well enough  and acted well enough so that you can care about them. The effects in some of these movies support the film in many cases  and you may like them for the originality. Almost nothing is true in 'Coronado'. The subject and the script is at the level of cheap comics - just a cliche. The effects are cheap - and I do not care that the film is low budget - you can do a lot with low budget  but you need some talent. There are so many continuity and other directing errors as in ten other films. You do not care for the characters  you do not laugh  and at the end of the film you are left wondering if the parody was intentional or not. The only quality I could find is the scenery  there are some good locations  worth a much better film.   2/10 on my personal scale. The worst film of the year so far.\n",

      "If you are looking for a cinematic masterpiece  this ain't it. If you are looking for one of those awful movies that are so horrible that they are actually good  then this may be for you. There are so many unintentional laughs in this film  that it could almost be considered a comedy. Let's start with the opening titles  that say Jack-O  and then add the word Lantern  as if the viewer wasn't able to figure out the movie was about a pumpkin by the giant pumpkin shown on both the cover and in the opening scene of the movie. After that  the movie goes in about 20 different directions  none of which make much sense. Jack-o is everywhere  he's in people's houses  in the woods  and yet he doesn't ever seem to do much of anything. He does make a few kills  but the long buildup to those killings is so poorly acted and constructed you almost wish Jack-o would take out his rage on you the viewer. Other than that  the plot consists of poor acting  gratuitous nudity  and a ridiculous plot line. The acting in this film is among the worst I've ever seen in my 35 plus years of movie-watching. The boy who is the lead in the film (the director's son) has about as much emotion as a corpse  and just about all of the other actors/actresses are just as bad for numerous reasons (especially the bug-eyed lady with eyes bigger than saucers). But  having said all this  if you take this for what it is  (that is a steaming pile of dung) then you will get a few laughs from this movie. What I also found amusing is that the makers of the DVD saw fit to release a 10th Anniversary Version of this movie (as if the original wasn't good enough). And someone actually had the idea of making a behind the scenes mini film which is also included in the 10th anniversary edition (I'm not sure why).......I'll give this 3 smashed pumpkins out of 10...\n",

      "While the David Lynch version of Dune is choppy  awkward  and unfaithful to the novel  it is visually well designed and well acted. The best one can say about the Sci Fi channel's attempt to make Dune into a miniseries is that it's ambitious. Actually  that is virtually the only positive praise one can offer. The actors (with few exceptions) seem happy to recite their lines with the least emotion possible  and the least appropriate accents. The costumes seem to have been designed by someone with a a large surplus of Mylar fabric on hand and an unhealthy love of unflattering headwear.  In part  this miniseries suffers from living in the shadow of Lynch's already well known effort. However  it takes elements from Lynch's film which were not present in the novel and copies them nearly wholesale (i.e. the Guild Steersman's navigation sequence)  and this only encourages encourages negative comparison to Lynch's film. A for effort. D for virtually everything else.\n",

      "I have watched THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL with the avowed object of refuting this so called scientific atheist . I don't know where to start as he is such a rich source of stupidity.  He is obviously not a statistician else the odds of 2/1 of him burning for all eternity would have pushed him towards belief in God  He regards science as religion and expects us to believe him as we do God. One has only to look at the language used in his postulations.   Regarding Faith. This commodity is used extensively in everyday behaviour. Just think about it. When he gets in an electrician be believes that it will be wired correctly and trustfully turns on the switch. When he gets in a plumber he pulls the chain in his bathroom and expects the water to flow in the right direction. Regarding faith in science When I was in chemistry class I believed and was taught that the atom was the smallest particle and the onion skin theory of electrons both of which have now been discounted. I was taught this as the atomic theory 'writ in stone' so to speak. So why should we believe any scientist especially when he goes beyond the parameters of his field? Dawkins states that religion will be the downfall of civilisation. Religion is civilisation. Can he  or any other atheist  please tell us what civilisation was founded and nurtured by atheism  barbarism or savagery please? He is now living in the last stages of a Christian based civilisation and taking all the benefits from it without any admission for its source. I found Dawkins to be arrogant  dictatorial  judgmental  an obvious believer in eugenics and a Nazi in his attitude towards the young. How dare he say what a parent can teach their child. The child is theirs  not the nation's and as the parents bequeath to it their genetics  so do they bequeath their beliefs. His dismissal of Adam as he never existed as he has no proof was an example of this same attitude. So I have no proof that Joe Blogs lives in New York but he well may do. I just haven't found the proof yet. That does not negate his existence I note his argument with the Bishop of Oxford that the prelate is selective with what he takes and believes in the Bible. Well  Dawkins also does this. Where does he draw the line between it as a historical document and a religious statement? He is also selective. I heard the lot when Dawkins came up with the ALTRUISTIC gene. What a hoot. He is desperately looking for proof for his wackiness and as the Piltdown Man was invented  so now we have this so called ALTRUISTIC gene which predisposes us to looking after our young and other members of our 'group' The trouble is that all animals do this - not just apes  and with evolution it is survival of the fittest. not the kindest and if he really thinks we are becoming kinder as a race he is not reading the same newspapers as I am I found his arrogance beyond belief in declaiming that as we only have this life  we should enjoy it to the full. So how does he equate this with his obvious position as a well off European to a destitute person in Africa who has had all her family wiped out and probably raped and is starving. Will he help her? I note that all his opposition to religion is a) that they go to war. Well G K Chesterton declared that the only war worth fighting was a war for religion b) we are against using contraception and abortion and homosexuality. All sins against the 6th commandment. Funny that.  As a Catholic I find his dismissal of Pius XII's pronouncement of the Dogma of the Assumption in 1958 to be erroneous. He   Pius  never said that it was revealed to him while he was sitting somewhere by himself. In case Dawkins does not know it  Revelation ended with the last Apostle. Pius would have taken years of advice and studied documents handed from down over the centuries to have come up with this pronouncement. Also as a Catholic I find his dismissal of all religious people as satisfied. what utter rubbish. We  everyday fight the world  the flesh and the devil. We are the Church Militant. We are also able to glory at a sunset and admire the beauties of nature even if we believe in God. The trouble with Dawkins was that he interviewed whacky zealots and extrapolated them to all of us.\n",

      "This is a comedy/romance movie directed by Andy Tennant  starring Will Smith  Eva Mendes and Kevin James.  It is about a professional dating doctor -Will Smith - known as 'Hitch' who helps men to land dates with the women they are interested in. He is currently helping a shapely  clumsy Albert who is obsessed with a very powerful  famous and rich woman called Allegra. At the same time  Hitch has become interested in a gossip columnist  Sara  - Eva Mendes - who has been assigned to write about Allegra. When the best girlfriend of Sara has a love disillusion with a man that Sara thinks that is a client of Hitch  she plots a revenge against Hitch and the misunderstanding leads the two couples to a conflictive situation This film is not one that men should see as it has a lot of male-bashing and both subtle and blatant male-hating. There are also double standards that you would have to be blind not to spot. Hitch and Sara are both very guarded around the opposite sex  Hitch still likes women despite his burns from them in the past and is teaching men to make them happy. But of course Sara  is a sexist bigot who makes frequent sexist comments along the lines of men want to have sex with anything that walks. Shes self-obsessed and knows she looks like a goddess and knows there are no 'real men' out there. What annoyed me most of all was the 'bad' guy who wanted a quick fumble with Sara's best friend who is the classic example of a defenceless 'victim' and even after being turned down physically by Hitch  receives as blow to the pills from Sara  after which she says Now I'm satisfied. Add to that the women are still oppressed vibes you get from Allegra not being allowed to spend her own money after asking permission from a table of men. In spite of all the rubbish assumptions and generalisations - Women can always tell when you ain't being straight with them? - this movie does have the correct point that in America  love simply doesn't exist. There are some funny parts in this film  such as Albert and his dancing habits but this film overall  only beats the dreadful film Honey by a marginal amount.\n",

      "Jesus Franco is pretty hit or miss on his films & I'd say this was a miss  that is  unless you're into total sleaze. I will say that the man has an eye for a good shot  even if it involves topless women with machine guns silhouetted against the ocean. This is overall pretty ridiculous and the acting is horrible  but the acting is the least of what this is about. And what is it about? Well  it's about 102 minutes of lesbianism  women picking and shoveling in the hot sun for no apparent reason  and just about as much sleaze as you can stand and maybe then some. Most notable (?) is a scene involving one young woman who is tied to a chair and an apparently amorous German Shepherd  and while what's going on is merely implied (thankfully) it is probably a scenario that I could have done without.

      "Roll up! Roll up! It's Big Gay Bruce and his Big Gay Death Cannon! Plausible plot? Unnecessary! Decent acting? Unnecessary! Respect shown to its mighty progenitor? Unnecessary! Yes it's another offensively stuffed turkey in the Butch Bruce canon.  I mean where do you start with this film? Okay  let's begin with the woeful misapprehension people might have that this was  in some way  related to either the book or the original film  The Day of the Jackal. It's not. In fact it's so different (and so bad) that Fredrick Forsyth asked to have his name taken off it. Now I'm not necessarily a stuffy Brit who can't hack Hollywood remaking British films. Well  okay  maybe I am a bit like that  but fortunately it's a redundant point in this case. This film is so different to the original that the name and the odd reference are the only things that survive.  Now let's move to the premise. Cheesy Russian gangster gets killed in a Moscow police raid (somehow involving the FBI although no one bothers to explain why). In revenge  brother of gangster decides to wreak vengeance by killing the wife of the US President (although again no one bothers to explain why this is a good move  although to be fair it was pre-9-11  so he wasn't to know it would have resulted in the US airforce carpet bombing Eastern Europe). Gangster hires nasty killer (Willis). Police hire cuddly killer (Gere)  cuddly killer tracks nasty killer. Police fanny around and periodically get killed. Cuddly killer kills nasty killer. First lady is saved and we all realise that the IRA are just this bunch of real sweet guys y'know  who just happen to want to kill innocent people. Nice.  Let's put to one side the distasteful Hollywood habit of playing in the troubles of Northern Ireland like it was a sandpit in a theme park (I deal with this point more extensively on the message boards). If Hollywood directors want to cast the Belfast butchers as hookers with hearts of gold  that's up to them. I  of course  reserve the right to despise them for it. It's a free country.  More egregious  however  is the fact that the film manages to patronise and insult the Irish while trying to support them. That's not politically distasteful  it's far worse: it's incompetent. It's no wonder  for instance  that Gere still looks so damn good  given that he slept through the entire six months it took to make this piece of cra*p. The fact that Gere's accent is not only Southern Irish  but an appalling parody of Southern Irish shows that the filmmakers weren't looking much beyond America to make money from this film. Then there is that lovely scene at the end where Sidney Poitier (a complete waste of space in this film) says he's off for a coffee  offers to get our cuddly IRA man one  then casually says Ah  but then you guys drink Guinness don't you. Yeah that's right Sidney; the Irish live on Guinness and potatoes.  While we're on the subject of Poitier: why? In the original film the detective is the tracker. In Jackal  Gere is the tracker. So what does Poitier do? Well  he just hangs around and looks like a tw*at of course. He's got absolutely nothing to do apart from call in the marines at the end  and he only does this because the nice IRA man tells him to.  While we're on the subject of Gere: why? I suppose it's only a matter of time before Hollywood remakes Gandhi with Vin Diesel playing ex-Mujahideen Commando Mahatma Gandhi beheading his way through 1940s and 50s India (he is  after all  a bit dark of hue and therefore very likely to be a Muslim fundamentalist). Let's not forget that Gere's character is a killer and therefore a nasty piece of work. And if he's not  why does he know The Jackal? If he's not  why does he know all his moves? And if he is  why is he such a limp biscuit and such a loveable person?   All this goes to show that the makers of this film couldn't be bothered to (a) think about the plot (b) have the characters making decisions that were in keeping with their character(c) avoid cheesy stereotypes like having the big boss bad guy kill his own friend  I honestly thought this had turned into a Bond movie (d) give the central characters something to do (e) credit the audience with a modicum of intelligence.  This film is an insult to the British and Irish killed at the hands of terrorists  it's an insult to the Irish people  it's an insult to not great  but pretty good film it rips off  and an insult to the intelligence. But most of all  and most unforgivable  it is an insult to my a*rse for having to sit through the over two hours of run time it took to finish. Honestly  you'd think with no plot  no characters and no dialogue  it would be over in no time. But they didn't even have the decency to quit early.\n",

      "Simply awful. I'm including a spoiler warning here only because of including a coupla jokes from the movie - there is nothing else to spoil  as it is already rotten. This dross was made during what must have been one of Sellers' For A Few Dollars More periods  when he'd participate in any crap for a few bucks. I'd seen this as a 15-year- old high school student in 1972  and loathed it then. No need to view it again; after 35 years I remember it now as one of the top five worst movies I'd seen as a kid. As I recall  Sellers had more of an ongoing cameo role than a lead here  but even his presence couldn't ameliorate the stale jokes  lame plot  and infantile repartee. One ongoing theme revolves around Sellers' use of his fingers: In one scene  he holds up his open hand to a group of medicos  and by folding down his fingers  enumerates the groups for which a hospital exists - the interns  the nurses  the administrators  etc. - until only his middle finger is left up  whereupon he says ...and the patients! Har Har. In another scene  to avoid costly lab tests  he dips a finger into a urine sample and sticks it into his mouth to check for sugar  then exhorts the interns gathered around him to do the same  which they do. He then advises them that he'd placed his middle finger in the urine  but sucked on the index finger  and admonishes them to pay attention. Hee Hee. (The only reason that I remember this  and this movie  and am writing this review  is that a friend told me an even dumber version of this 'joke' today). If yu laik thiss  you gonna luv dis movey. If not  see 'Hospital'  with George C. Scott (came out the same year  1972) for some genuine  marvelous black medical humor. Better yet  read 'The House of God'  by Samuel Shem  and if you can  see the movie version of it  which has never been released (please make a copy and send it to me - I'd love to finally see it).\n",

      "Let Freedom Ring was probably made with the best of intentions  but it sends out a curious mixed message in the final product.  The folks at a western town where the railroad is coming through are overwhelmed by the arrival of immigrant railroad workers  working on the railroad being financed by robber baron Edward Arnold. There are a few ranchers and farmers whose land stands in the railroad's path and these folks are dealt with summarily by Arnold's hired men. One man who won't give in is Lionel Barrymore whose son is coming home from Harvard a lawyer and ready to take up the rancher's cause.  Only Nelson Eddy decides the best way to fight is to go Zorro on the bad guys. But other than Charles Butterworth no one knows he's the Wasp (a very interesting choice of names by the way).   What Arnold's done is used the tried and true methods of the political bosses of the east  getting the immigrants to vote. Nelson's idea is simple  if the immigrants only knew the truth about what a bad guy Arnold is  they'll vote with the original settlers and knock out the alien urban political machine in their midst. He kidnaps newspaper editor Raymond Walburn and takes him and the press to a mountain cave where some subversive newspapers are printed and distributed.  The railroad workers are a real mixed bunch of immigrants  not the Irish working west or the Chinese working east as history has it. It's a real United Nations working on Arnold's railroad. The workers are kept in line by foreman Victor McLaglen and Nelson has the unenviable task of beating some sense into him like John Wayne did in The Quiet Man.  Of all the films that starred Jeanette and Nelson and they certainly have come down in history as a duo  this was the worst of what they did at MGM. Nelson is about to be hanged along with Barrymore for crimes that are undefined at best  but certainly nothing worth being hung for. And Virginia Bruce who plays the Nelson's girlfriend saves the day with a rendition of My Country Tis of Thee that the immigrants join in with. In the face of a revolt by his paid for immigrant voters  Arnold quite rationally packs up and leaves town to build his railroad somewhere else.  I kid you not  that's the ending here. Just what is the message  vote with the settlers and lose your jobs with Arnold? But somehow you'll get by here?   I do wonder some times if 20 years from after the incidents of this film take place and the town as settled into a sleepy backwater of the west while some towns where the railroad has come through that are now cities  that the good citizens of that town haven't rethought about what Nelson Eddy did. If they did they're probably running him out on a rail.  Nelson is of course in good voice and has a variety of concert and popular pieces to sing including a ballad to the immigrants written by Sigmund Romberg  Where Else But Here. The song is a heartfelt tribute from an immigrant who did make good in his adopted country. Too bad it didn't have a better venue.  The almost platinum blonde Virginia Bruce I'm sure is dubbed here. And I'm sure Jeanette MacDonald was just as happy she wasn't accompanying Nelson on this trip west.\n",

If it weren't for Joel  Crow  and Tom Servo constantly making wisecracks  it wouldn't be possible to sit through this piece of crap. You have a hero called Ator who looks a lot like Jeff Spigoli in Fast Times at Ridgemont High and appears only slightly more intelligent  just without being stoned. He takes on cavemen (the cave dwellers?) invisible guys  a giant snake (with a bunch of anal retentive snakes that like to line up all the skulls to face the same way)  invents a hang glider which suspiciously looks like a modern aluminum one with some cheap vines wrapped around it  and then does battle with the evil John Saxon-looking dude.

At the very least it's unintentionally funny in spots and has a definite air of creepiness and discomfort (a face burning scene  the part with the disfigured bride).   This baby falls into the so bad it's entertaining category to me  and for that alone I would give it a star. The effects are terrible  the acting is abysmal  and the whole thing looks like it was shot in a day. You gotta love that toy ship at the beginning  too!

      "An odd  willfully skewed biopic of Dyan Thomas in which we hear little more than a dozen lines of his poetry. Instead we have to endure a raw character exposée seen through the prism of his proto-bigamous relationship with wife (Sienna Miller) and childhood love (Keira Knightley). Matthew Rhys plays Thomas with sufficient charm to inoculate us against his otherwise repellent self-interest and Cillian Murphy makes up the persistently tense lovetet.  The film never seems to decide on where it's going. There's no arc so much as a viaduct from one end of the war to the other. Maybury seems much more interested in his two female leads (who wouldn't!?) than in the man who brings them together and then divides them. Miller is the choice of the two (I found Knightley competent at best but then I have never found her sympathetic) but they both offer dreadfully inconsistent Welsh accents. Other funny decisions include too much for the inconsequential character of William (Murphy)  arty production (eg double crossfades) that is neither impressionist nor symbolic and the old chestnut act of period footage which doesn't blend. 4/10\n",

      "I do not generally appreciate light-weight attempts at creating humourous stories  which means that Anita no perd el Tren cannot score very high for me. The story is good: a middle-aged but still good-looking woman finds a new love. But the attempts at making this film as a romantic comedy only managed at times to be somewhat comical.   Rosa María Sardà has ably demonstrated that she can be a serious actress in such productions as Amic/Amat (qv)  Todo Sobre mi Madre (qv)  Las Amargas Lágrimas de Petra von Kant (qv) and El Embrujo de Shanghai (qv). However the powers that be have over the years dished her out a lot of trivial stuff  for the cinema and for TV. Something similar could be said of José Coronado: perfectly able to produce serious performances. María Barranco belongs safely in this grouping.  Such that  in the end  I was left with the feeling that I would be real pleased to see a new making of this film  in a serious tone  which would allow the actors to really show their performing skills. And the curious thing is that it should be done with exactly the same leading actors. Wasted talent on a rather silly film that could have been very promising indeed.\n",

      "Eaten Alive follows a young woman (Janet Agren) who searches for her lost sister. Turns out her sister have joined a sect that has disappeared into the jungles of Borneo. With Vietnam veteran Mark at her side she sets off to find her sister.  As per usual  the acting isn't of the highest quality but you do get cannibal flick poster girl Me Me Lai spending most of the time on screen with her breast bare  female lead Janet Agren covered in gold paint and abused with a dildo dipped in snake blood among other things. Now that's gotta count for something!   But  I must say that I find it bit hard to recommend this title. If you are fan of the genre  you will most likely recognize every gore scene in the movie bar a select few. And I mean that literally. A lot of the gore scenes are lifted straight out other Cannibal movies  like MAN FROM DEEP RIVER and LAST CANNIBAL WORLD. There's probably more movies stuck in there.  Ultimately  this is one for die-hard fans to check off their list. If you haven't seen any Italian jungle movies  you'd be better off watching CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST and if you're an avid fan  you have seen most of the gore scenes in other movies.\n",

      "The film begins with a little girl (Rita) seeing her father killed. He apparently was a criminal who squealed on his fellow crooks. Later  and this part makes little sense  the girl has grown to adulthood and STILL her father's past haunts her! A bit later  Rita meets a good-for-nothing and dates him. During one of their dates  he's a bit intoxicated AND driving like a total fool. The cops give chase and he speeds away--killing a pedestrian in the meantime. Here comes the Really stupid part. He convinces her to confess to the crime  as he assures her his lawyers can get her off scot-free. Why  oh why  would she agree to this?! Yet she does and spends the next couple years in prison!! And  soon after her conviction  this boyfriend disappears--showing that he's a total heel. What a chump!!! Later  after her release  her friend (Jack La Rue) informs her about the truth about the boyfriend. Then  he explains  the boyfriend's family is loaded and she should shake them down for lots of cash for all the trouble he put her to by taking the rap. Frankly  this does make sense--as they certainly owe it to her--especially since they knew she'd go to prison and had every intention of using her and then casting her aside.  Now the idea of bleeding money from the rich chumps is a good plot idea. However  there is no way this would have occurred in the first place because it's hard to believe anyone could be so stupid as to take the rap for a hit-and-run! In an interesting twist  the dumb lady decides on a life of crime--donning a wig and picking up a rich guy--taking him into the desert and robbing him at gunpoint! Wow...how she's changed! Apparently she loves the idea of stealing from phonies--i.e.  rich hypocrites. However  and this made no sense  she soon stopped doing this and began shaking down the father of the old boyfriend--why she bothered to do some petty robberies in the meantime made little sense. And  what also was a bit hard to believe was that instead of wanting money from the old jerk  she was interested in getting him to put his influence behind a mob-controlled man for mayor. Odd...very  very odd.  In the meantime  another plot develops involving a young Alan Ladd. He's an undercover agent who has infiltrated the mob. He was chosen because he just happens to be a dead ringer for a real crook--what a cliché! But what makes no sense is that this real crook isn't in jail and is out committing crimes while the fake one is infiltrating the mob in another town.  Eventually  evidence that Ladd is able to uncover is enough to issue warrants to the mob kingpins--including Rita. This is a case of very bad timing  as in the interim  she's made a decision to become a decent and legitimate woman  as she's met a really nice guy who she wants to marry! Wow ...what are the odds?! Overall  this is a goofy and rather dumb movie that suffers from kitchen sink syndrome--in other words  there is way too many plot elements and weird twists to make the movie the least bit believable. Plus  since the movie is only a little over an hour long  it all seems very forced and contrived. It's a relatively bad B-movie from crap-studio PRC of note only for the performance of Alan Ladd just before he gained great fame the following year at Paramount.  By the way  this DVD was released by Alpha Video---a company which sometimes releases some wonderfully obscure titles (mostly public domain) but which NEVER cleans up the prints or adds closed captions. In other words  the DVD production values are strictly 3rd-rate...at best.\n",

      "La Ragazza del Vagone Letto  or Terror Express! as it was called on the version I saw  starts as various passengers board a long distance train. Three thuggish idiots  Dave  Phil & Ernie (Carlo De Mejo) board & it's clear that they're there to cause trouble as they intimidate & verbally abuse the other passengers & staff. As the train speeds along things turn nasty when a prostitute named Juliette (Silvia Dionisio) refuses to have sex with Dave  he & his mates decide to hold the entire train hostage so they can have an orgy with Juliette &  well not much else actually happens apart from some hero cop & his prisoner who set about saving the day. Erm  that's it really...  This Italian production was directed by Ferdinando Baldi & is complete total & utter crap from start to finish. The script by George Eastman as Luigi Montefiori could just as easily be described as a really boring porno as much as a horror/thriller. It is tediously slow  it's 35 minutes before anything even remotely sleazy happens & as a whole the film lacks the sort of exploitation elements that Italian sleaze & horror was delivering at that time. The film can be compared to another Italian production the infinitely better The House on the Edge of the Park (1980) made the same year  it's a very broad comparison though as everything that made The House on the Edge of the Park the notorious film that it is is absent from La Ragazza del Vagone Letto  there's no blood  no gore  almost no violence  there's only a couple of really tame rapes  the story has no twists or turns & as it's incredibly boring to watch. Italian sleaze & horror from the late 70's & early 80's isn't known for it's strong story lines or great scripts but this films really does scrape the bottom-of-the-barrel on all counts. The character's are awful  the film spends the first 30 plus minutes building them up & giving some background as to why they're on the train but this is all quickly forgotten & comes to absolutely nothing. I hated the lame ending as well & I don't know if I missed something but was any sort of reasonable explanation given as to why these three lamebrains would hijack a train? I don't think there was  was there? I'm sorry but because your angry at a prostitute is not enough of a reason  surely the filmmakers could have come up with something a bit more substantial & interesting if not more plausible. In my opinion this film stinks  it's as simple & straight forward as that I'm afraid.  Director Baldi does an OK job  to be fair he only has one corridor & a few train compartments to work with so I'll cut him some slack  having said that the film does become very repetitive. There is no style & he films the sex scenes like a bad soft core porno complete with awful romantic sounding piano music. There is NOT ONE SINGLE DROP OF BLOOD SPILT IN THE ENTIRE FILM  that's right not one single drop. Forget about any gore or violence as you'll be very disappointed if you do  like I did. There are a couple of rapes but they're amateurishly staged & have zero impact  the nasty exploitation & sleaze of say I Spit on Your Grave (1978) or The Last House on the Left (1972) is not here.  Technically La Ragazza del Vagone Letto is OK & it's quite well made on what must have been a low budget but the setting obviously helped keep the cost down to a minimum. The acting is poor as usual  although since it was dubbed the original performances have been lost. Fans of Italian horror will recognise a lot of the voices here.  La Ragazza del Vagone Letto is a terrible film  it's just my opinion but I was bored to tears waiting for something to happen & when it eventually never I felt cheated  I want those 80 minutes of my life back. This piece of crap isn't even fit to grace the 99p VHS bargain bin in your local Blockbuster  one to avoid.\n",

      "I honestly fail to understand why people love this show so much. A friend of mine watches this and since I like sci-fi  I tried to watch along since the plot of the show sounded promising  but in truth it really is a very boring show. The only thing that will keep you awake during this show are the video game-like CGI-effects and the complete overuse of muppets. Note that I call it muppets because they actually really look like muppets  not like the aliens they should be.  Speaking of which; the muppets and make-up effects are horribly overused in this show. You have this guy who could be best described as a alien/dwarf-hybrid  you have a pale girl who looks like a cheesy vamp-girl  you've got a floating potty-mouth frog-alien... It just feels very unnecessary and furthermore even to the point that you feel distracted from the whole storyline about a lost astronaut.  Every episode is also too much of a stand-alone. The creators of this show directed this in such a way that every episode almost feels like a whole other show. At least up until the point that you see the main-characters/muppets again  that is. The whole plot about the main-character getting back to earth is way to much pushed to the background at points. The acting is also quite bad.  Conclusion: if you want good sci-fi  just look somewhere else. This isn't even real sci-fi to begin with in my opinion  since the show is more aimed at fantasy-elements with all the puppetry and weird dreams going on. And if you just want to see muppets then I suggest you watch the Muppet Show and feel glad that this abomination of a show has come to a end.  By the way; doesn't anyone have dejavu's with the concept of a living spaceship? Ohyeah thats right; Doctor Who started that concept almost about 30 years ago! This show is like a collection of 'sci-fi' leftovers. Scripts and events that were abandoned for a good reason  only to be picked up by this horrible show.\n",

      "The first time I had heard of Guest House Paridiso was in the  er... washroom after having just seen Fight Club. In each urinal was deposited a small  round black circle. When the circle came into contact with moisture (to put it delicately)  it caused a colour picture to form  with photographs of the two stars and the tag line You'll P*** Yourself Laughing. When you'd finished washing your hands  the circle had dried and faded to black again  waiting to spring it's surprise on the next victim.  Okay  maybe the punchline wasn't terribly sophisticated  but you have to admit it was innovative. In fact  I think I can honestly say I've never seen anything like it in my life before  and these days of over a century of cinema and marketing  that's a real feat. What a pity the film that went with it failed to live up to the promise.  I hate to pan Guest House Paridiso and I am indebted to Rik Mayall (Richard Twat) and Adrian Edmondson (Eddie Elizabeth Ndingombaba) for many years of laughter through their appealing television series  be it the invention of The Young Ones (1982-1984)  the sitting room plays of Bottom (1991-1995)  or even solo work  such as Rik in the New Statesman (1988-1993). In fact  this would have made an hilarious 45 minute tv special. Unfortunately  its an 89 minute film.  There's definitely some merit to be had  and I laughed continuously throughout the protracted finale  which spoofed the Exorcist and Raiders of the Lost Ark  and involved... well  you'll have to see that bit for yourself. Yet often the pace is leaden  and a sterile atmosphere is throughout. The two stars (Edmondson taking his usual backseat  this time due to the fact that he adequately directs) never really get into first gear  Mayall only sporadically showing the foul-mouthed mania that makes us love him on the small screen. Indeed  the writers' presumption that we are already familiar with the characters leads to them being underdelivered to the audience. The slight hints of depth seen in the series (Richie's effeminate  failed social-climbing for example) are not present here  and instead we are left with parodies of parodies.  The Fawlty Towers accusation does pass water  complete with drunken chef and unseen  called-for waiter Pasquele  which uncannily rhymes with Manuel. Some of the ideas  such a hotel next to a nuclear reactor with a childrens' swing hanging over a cliff face  are very  very funny  but ultimately the frenetic pace is stolen  the two constantly looking for a studio audience that isn't there  and all the dead laugh areas patched up with incidental comedy music that would have been dated in a Carry On film two decades ago.  Paridiso's brand of puerile  sadistic  perverse humour IS funny  and I feel sure it will make you laugh ... just not as often as it should.\n",

      "This film was such a mess I actually reimbursed my friends who I dragged to see it. The only reason I went to see it was that my friend was an apprentice editor on the shoot.  I'm sure that this film was meant to be campy  but the approach was so heavy-handed and self-reflexive it turned out really flat. Judd Nelson stars as an obsequious garbage man who is a hack comedian on the side. His life is hell and made worse by his obnoxious and overbearing companion Bill Paxton (who I feel embarrassed for - this was a really tasteless role for a talented actor). A freak accident alters Nelson's career course and mayhem ensues.  The attempts at humor were corny  predictable and often base and tasteless. Wayne Newton in the cast as a talent agent is a novelty but he adds nothing - comedically or otherwise.  Overall  it's a very weak and uncreative attempt at camp humor that goes over like a lead balloon. At least you could laugh AT Plan 9 From Outer Space. This one just makes you wonder who thought this was a good enough idea to finance and film. One of the all time worst bombs you'll ever witness.\n",

      "This film follows the life of a great guitar player  who wants to make it big but acts irresponsibly almost to the point of self destruction.  I was expecting the usual Woody Allen witty dialogs  sarcasm and humour  but Sweet and Lowdown failed to provide any. The main character  Emmet Ray  is an egocentric  rude  irresponsible and hurtful man. He is so unlikeable  that I do not want to now about him  or care about him. I wonder why a film about him has to be made. The pacing of the story is slow  making the film a terrible bore. Even Sean Penn's great acting fails to revive the film to a watchable level.  I like Woody Allen's films a lot  but Sweet and Lowdown is a major disappointment.\n",

      "This rendition of Noah's Ark has set Hallmark's (and Turner's) reputation back about 100 years. However  the production has it's bright side...a learning experience for neophyte movie entrepreneurs in how not to make a movie  Where in the annals of Biblical literature and common sense can one find these quotes and situations:  Ok  boys  let's saddle up. It's too bad that God created the sun to shine only during the day when we really needed it at night. We're not kissing...we're only whispering in each others' mouths.  Lumber for building the Ark with Georgia Pacific stamped on it. Metal nails. Kids flying kites. A peddler (how can James Coburn sleep after this) selling Chinese hats. Pirates attacking a wooden Ark  which they wished to capture  with flaming tar balls of fire shot from catapults. Glass bottles of wine (Noah was in a continual state of inibriation. It was a miracle that he could see the Ark let alone build it.) Lady Godiva (Mary Steenberg in a blond wig tromping around the Ark on a white horse...still rated G) Warding off Biblical pirates with an iron (teflon-lined?) frying pan. Landing on Mount Ararat after having passed through the Straights of Hercules.  etc.  etc.  etc.  Special effects...you've got to see them in order not to believe them.  The list goes on. This movie must not be missed; but if you want the full TV version  you must call NBC for the screen version...but only if you agree to absolve NBC of all responsibility of ever having aired the thing in the first place. Only the expurgated version exists in video stores (no pirates  etc.)...that is  those video stores that dare to stock it.  Marvin Cohn  \n",

      "'Ernest Saves Christmas' is comedian Ernest's Christmas special film. In this film  Ernest has to find a successor to Santa Claus in order for Christmas to continue. Along the way  he meets a young girl who is a thief and who ends up stealing something very important of Santa's (I won't tell you what that is; you'll just have to watch the film for yourself). Like most Ernest films  there is a lot of slapstick humor involved.  This film is probably one of Ernest's best films. It's funny  and it has some important lessons to learn regarding friendship and family and not being afraid to show love. It's not the best Christmas film around  but it is a good one to get you in the Christmas spirit. It's a little bit sad that the film is a little dated now.\n",

      "Controversial German journalist Jutta Rabe who herself got divers to the Estonia wreck  put this silly thriller together to save her investment.  Donald Sutherland is of course always watchable - but he's only in three scenes. He delivers his material perfectly - as you can ask from a professional. Also  the main lead  Jürgen Prochnov  is at times very good.  The rest of the cast is  however  bad. The actress that plays the Swedish minister secretary (or whatever she was - she seems not listed in the cast) is EXTREMELY bad.  The script has some nice ideas  and the story is actually kind of interesting. The final screenplay should have been re-written a couple of more times though. Some scenes are plain ridiculous - especially the end scenes.  The film is almost 2 hours  which is about 45 minutes too long. Presented as a 60 minutes TV-film  this could have been really interesting. As a two hour feature  it's pretentious  boring  stupid and plain out silly.  Jutta Rabe might be a good journalist (her ideas about governments using Estonia to transport military items from Estonia to Sweden have been concluded as true recently  when the Swedish military officially said that they actually used the ship Estonia for this)  but as a film producer she sucks.  The director  the writer and the actors suck more.  I give this film 3/10. I would've given it a 1  if it wasn't for the fact that the story is quite interesting at times  Donald Sutherland is in it and it has real stock footage.  But we don't even see the boat sink! What kind of movie about a ship that sinks is that? Like a werewolf movie without werewolves...\n",

      " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.   Handsome guide Peter Brown (as Jim Pendrake) takes pretty blonde Ahna Capri (as Terry Greene) and her good-looking brother Tom Simcox (as Art Greene) into the Venezuelan jungle  to admire the view  and take wildlife pictures. After they hook up with hunky big-game hunter William Smith (as Caribe)  psychological dramatics surface.   A pivotal scene  with Mr. Brown reposing in the vee of a tree  and sharing a cigarette with Mr. Simcox  is nicely staged. The circular direction reappears in the later fight between Brown and Mr. Smith; and  it is effective. Simcox' early sex romp adds nothing to the story; it could have been cut  to take advantage of what seems like flirting between the Brown and Simcox characters. An attraction between Brown and Ms. Capri could have been played up  also.   The music  including Jim Stein's Love All Things That Love the Sun  is fine; but the film needs to be re-tracked  to cut out animals which do not appear on screen. And  there is far too much superfluous footage on display. Piranha is a case where less would have been more.\n",

      "It must say something about the state of our nation that this programme is one of the most popular currently screened.   The 'square' is peopled by such a miserable  untrustworthy  amoral  spiteful  unrelentingly dour group of characters as can be imagined. Everyone is stabbing someone in the back  everyone is attempting to commit adultery  everyone is trying to cheat someone. That  or they are being stabbed  cuckolded or swindled. Nobody is cheerful. Nobody laughs. Nobody has a blinding stroke of luck or a really nice day. It's hell  with cockney accents.  I suspect this programme must be sponsored by The Samaritans. It's perfect viewing for the depressed. It doesn't cheer them up; what it does do is present a whole community of such terminally despondent sad-arses that viewers are moved to believe their lot really could be worse - they might be living in 'Albert Square'.  Apart from the above; as a representation of London's east end  it is pure hokum. The programme-makers have evidently never been across town. The first thing you encounter on the Mile End Road is a colossal mosque. And this pretty-well defines the racial majority of the population. White British Londoners are a dispersed and rapidly diminishing minority. A large advertisement hoarding presently near the Bow Road flyover  and sponsored by Tower Hamlets Health Care boasts that 'Eight out of ten members of the community can now see their doctor more quickly'. Ten healthy  smiling faces beam down at the observer in confirmation. Eight of them are dark-skinned...   What's more  I used to work with a bunch of Anglo-Saxon - dare I say 'pukka' - cockneys a few years ago. And I can tell you that a more obnoxiously racist experience I've never had. Each day was like an Oswald Moseley rally. They couldn't pass 5 minutes without denigrating some other race or nationality than their own  and in terms that were repulsive and obscene. 'Fackin' Pakis' and 'fackin' Maceroons' were the small change of conversation. In fact their entire (and extremely limited) stock of adjectives fixated upon sex-organs and their application. Alf Garnett was a paragon of liberal virtue in comparison.  Any programme that purported to represent London's native east-end Caucasians in their true nature would be completely unfit for broadcast - even after the 9 o-clock watershed. Imagine a Ku Klux Klan script written by Quentin Tarantino and you'd be somewhere near the mark. But when they weren't being inveterate bigots they were at least extremely cheerful.  I don't know how such a soap-opera came to be. This imaginary castaway island of white misery has absolutely no bearing upon real culture whatsoever. And if you're of a comparatively sanguine disposition  it will quickly reduce you to tears of grief. Comparatively ordinary actors pretending to be comparatively ordinary chronic-depressives with cockney accents - what's the point of that?  Dull  dreary  unrelentingly disillusional  and ethnically preposterous. The most popular programme of an apparently diseased and dying nation.  Avoid it like the plague.\n",

      "Today You Die starts as honourable criminal Harlan banks (producer Steven Seagal) is hired by sinister businessman Max Stevens (Kevin Tighe) to drive a security vehicle with $20 000 000 of cash in the back from point 'A' a Las Vegas casino to point 'B' him  sounds simple right? Well what Max forgot to tell Harlan that the money is stolen & that he has just become the getaway driver in an armed robbery. Bummer. Things get even worse for Harlan when the local cops catch him & chuck him in prison for a long time  however Harlan managed to hide the money before he was caught & with a nice $20 000 000 at stake & unaccounted for Harlan has to watch his back as the crooks want it as do Government agents. Harlan teams up with Ice Kool (!)(Anthony 'Teach' Criss) in prison & they both manage to escape at which point Harlan goes looking for some revenge...  Photographed & directed by Don E. FauntLeRoy one has to say that the shot in Eastern Europe straight-to-video action films that Steven Seagal specialises in these days aren't getting any better & Today You Die is a good case in point. This is a terrible film  simple as that really. The script by producer Danny Lerner  Kevin Moore & Les Weldon gives Seagal a new sort of character to get his none existent acting skills around  that of a criminal rather than some Government agent/cop/soldier/one man army cliché he usually plays. In fact if you were being charitable you could say Today You Die is a rip-off of Mel Gibson's excellent thriller Payback (1998) where he too played a really nasty piece of work to such good effect. While Payback was a superb uncompromising hard edged film noir type action thriller Today You Die isn't & pales into insignificance by comparison. Unfortunately here Seagal is terrible  he has no on screen presence or menace either & the audience is never quite sure whether he is meant to be a bad guy that we hate or not. For instance initially his character's is set up like a modern day Robin Hood as he steals from the rich drug dealers & scumbags to give to the poor (as well as keeping a tidy profit for himself) which is just ludicrous in itself but then it has Seagal turn around & murder a lot of people which contradicts the likable criminal with morals that the film went to such lengths to set up in the first place. The story is full of holes  for instance Agent Knowles is contacted by the on the run Harlan & is then reprimanded by her bent superior for meeting him & it turns out that he found out by tapped her phone. In that case why didn't her boss use the information he had to catch Harlan? The story is the usual dull predictable bland fight over lots of money with surprise surprise the investigating Government agent is actually a bad guy! Wow  I didn't see that coming I must say...  Director FauntLeRoy slows everything down to a snails pace & Today You Die feels like it goes on forever  the action scenes & set-pieces are also severely lacking in entertainment value. The infrequent fight scenes aren't great  most are either shot in shadow  very quickly cut & edited or with the camera played behind Seagal's character to try & disguise the fact that most of the stunt work done here is by a double. Again Seagal looks fat & out of shape & uses long baggy overcoats to try & hide it  it doesn't. There's a pretty cool car chase through the streets of Las Vegas in this at the start & I thought that Today You Die might be alright but it seems the whole sequence was stolen from another action film called Top of the World (1997) which is about a Las Vegas casino robbery  as well as using footage from that film Today You Die also edits scenes from the Charlie Sheen action film No Code of Conduct (1998)  the Jean-Claude Van Damme action film The Order (2001) & the Wesley Snipes prison based action film Undisputed (2002) so quite how much of Today You Die is original footage is anyone's guess.  Technically the film is alright  considering it's edited together from four separate films as well as it's own footage it's just about competent & consistent enough. All the footage of the US locations are obviously lifted from the films already mentioned with all the original footage shot on the cheap in Bulgaria. The rap style music that litter Today You Die is awful by the way. The acting is poor & Seagal just mumbles his way through his lines as usual.  Today You Die is a really bad film made up from other bad action films  Seagal looks old & fat  the action scenes are average at best & most of the story is fairly random & it doesn't come together at the end that well at all. One to avoid unless your a die hard Seagal fan  if such an animal even exists...\n",

In Mostly Martha  the food came alive- every scene was filmed in such a way you could taste it with your eyes - the smells  the textures. The food in 'No Reservations' was in the background - rarely did we get a closeup of the preparation; the characters were not real enough to carry the movie without it.

      "No serious spoilers  but some very minor ones.  Acacia  a Korean contribution to the ever popular Asian horror wave  concerns a husband and wife who decide that they're getting on a bit and decide to adopt a child. The child  who has an usual obsession with the dead tree in the family's garden  eventually disappears when the couple eventually have a child of their own and the aforementioned tree seems to hold a grudge against the family itself.  And that's about it. The film moves at a snails pace  clocking in at over 100 minutes with 80 minute material. It is essentially a thin family drama with a creepy tree  and there is very little in the way of scares  just shots of the tree with weird mumbling noises playing over the top. However  the idea of the tree being the child's mother is a pretty original one  but it isn't exactly exploited to its full potential. This sort of separates Acacia from much of the new wave it belongs to: films like Ju-On and Ring tend to do the opposite  and milk bland ideas until they are red in the face.  The film does begin to get going towards the end; however the realisation of the child's fate and the parent's actions not only dampen the earlier curiosity of the story  but are revealed with such machine gun editing that it's difficult to take in all at once. The final sequence is undoubtedly creepy  however it feels like too little too late.  Overall  the film does not feel too much like a Ring cash in  however with the film renaissance that Korea is currently going through  I couldn't help but feel this film could have been so much more.\n",

That we shouldn't bother to continue watching as the film won't be accurate or bloody  anyway? And they were right  too! The film isn't the least bit shocking and contains almost no blood or gore at all. Although I think that's mainly due to the low budget production values and not because of Dahmer's crimes being too horrific. Basically  The Secret Life: Jeffrey Dahmer is just one sequence repeated over and over again. Young  pitiful and mentally confused Jeffrey picks up victims (always males  as he was a homosexual)  kills them and then talks about how it wasn't his intention to hurt them and about how lonely he is. This gets boring really quick and even the admirable performance by unknown actor Carl Crew can't save this movie from being a total dud. Still  this version is much better than the pretentious and hopelessly muddled Dahmer that got released in 2002.\n",

It is clear there is virtually no plot  even if this part of Greek history is material for great movies. He simply had some supposedly symbolic (actually shambolic) scenes in his mind and he built a whole movie around them. Death is the main theme and is repeated ad nauseam  along with litanies  processions and the like  which should only be a vehicle for the movie but unfortunately it is the movie itself. A totally incoherent result  which can only leave you saying huh? or oh dear every two minutes.   There is no character development at all  nada  zilch.

This is irritating for us and degrading for some of the actors. He even managed to make one of my favourite Greek actors  Giorgos Armenis  seem wooden.   And going to the core of Angelopoulos film-making: No we're not idiots. We do not want chewed food. Please someone tell this guy symbolism has to be subtle.

The real Dr. Karkoff had a affair with Dr.Markoff's wife that lead to him to murder the real Dr.Markoff and then having his wife Lenore infected with acromegaly that made her look like the Elephant Man's sister. This was done so that no one would ever want to look at her and he could keep Lenore all to himself; but the disturbed Lenore later got even with her insane husband by killing herself.   This nut  the fake Dr. Markoff  then spots Patricia Lawrence  Wanda McKay  one evening at the theater where her father Tony Lawernce  Ralph Morgan  a world famous pianist is giving a concert. Enchanted by the lovely Patricia who's a dead ringer for his dead wife Lenore Dr. Markoff becomes obsessed with her and goes to extreme lengths to marry her even though she's want's nothing to do with him.  After getting ridicules in his efforts to get Patricia to fall in love with him  by sending her flowers with syrupy love notes attached to then as much as five times a day Tony goes to see the crazed Dr. Mankoff to tell him to stop annoying his daughter. It's then that Tony ends up getting knocked out by the good doctor who has him injected with a dose of acromegaly that turns him into a somewhat unsightly fellow. With his hands and body swelling up and not being able to play his beloved piano Tony is told by his Doctor Dr. Adams Sam Flint  that the only one who can cure him of that dreadful disease is non other then Dr. Markoff! the person who gave it to him.   The movie has the usual sub-plots with Dr. Markoff's assistant Maxine Tala Birell  who's also in love with him jealous of the phony doctor making a play for Patricia. There's also Dr. Markoff's hulking butler Glenn Strange who  like his pet gorilla  is just a big clumsy oaf who can't even subdue Maxine who's less the half the size. Strange ends up getting bopped on the head and knocked out cold by Patricia's boyfriend Bobby Blake  Terry Frost. As for the Gorilla he turns out to be but a big hairy wimp when he also tries to do in Maxine and is chased away  and locks himself back up in his cage  by the pet dog Ace. Dr. Markoff in his desperation to get Patricia to marry him promises her to cure her dad only to have her father break out of his chains and in the ensuing struggle with him ends up shooting Markoff dead with his own gun.   There is a happy ending to this whole mess with Maxine  who knew as much about Markoff's cure for acromegaly as he did  injecting Tony with a secret serum that made him as good as new. The movie ends  like it started  with Tony playing the piano to a packed and cheering house at the local theater.\n",

The ending features Michael McKean staring out a prison window saying There's lots of mysteries out there. followed by a clip montage/music video of all the uplifting moments in the tragically bad movie. Julinana Hatfield. Everything in between is awful. I struggled to find any value in this movie and have come up empty.

On paper the movie is below average. Women living together in a trailer. But what actually was produced was nearly unwatchable. The movie attempts to branch off in many directions but never follows through on any. The unappealing conflict of having their boyfriends in jail is never resolved. No conflict is ever resolved. There really is no conflict. The women attempt to become hookers  but that never happens. Instead they get jobs as a bartender and a shelf stocker. Sound exciting? IT wasn't. IT was stupid. And the bulk of the movie is the two women talking and generating contrived conflict. The women are capable actresses  but the script was beyond poor. Useless. This was a terrible movie  but it is even worst that they borough Burgess Meridith out of his retirement home to make it. Bad from start to finish. Like the lion without teeth  this film has no bite.\n",

      "Naturally Sadie is by far the worst show i have ever seen  it is such a piece of sh** and loaded with complete bullsh**. I didn't find any of the gags to be funny or somewhat clever  it was all awful jokes.  The acting sucks  many of the characters sucked at acting  Charlotte Arnold (Sadie) is such a terrible actor  the other characters suck too (Magaret  Rain  Hal).  The plot isn't unique and creative at all and the show is soo very much predictable. This is one of the worst shows made of all time  it shouldn't have even been made  the idiots who are responsible of writing this garbage should get fired (if they already didn't) The fist season was actually watchable but the second season was just a disaster  its too hard to watch this show  it is beyond awful.\n",

      "Wow  where to begin with this one. Well  if you enjoy laughing at the utter failures of filmmakers  then this one is for you. I bought this movie for 5 bucks because I never pass up an opportunity to laugh at B-movie God Casper Van Dien's blunders  and boy was this one of them. It may have been enough that this movie contains the single most lame movie monster ever. This thing  which is supposed to be an Indian ghost  looks more like a plastic candy bowl skeleton that you put on your front porch on Halloween. He dons a cape that is clearly a garbage bag  complete with what appears to be a bucket-shaped bonnet over his head. At some points this is a man in costume  at others it is clearly a plastic prop placed on top of a horse. This monster has the uncanny ability to see with predator vision  a clear rip-off  and can miraculously appear after throwing his spear. Sometimes the spear cuts people  sometimes it doesn't. This thing also manages to down a helicopter with a single arrow. Wow  this makes a much sense as when the kid blows up a spaceship with a firecracker at the end of Critters. This creature is impervious to bullets  but somehow dies at the end of the movie. At the end of his killing spree  which we never really find out why he is on  he gets blown up. This is an incredible feat  for we had already seen this thing blow up 3 times in the film. But  I guess this last time was the charm.   And don't even get me started on the lameness of the other characters. First of all  what Delta Force unit employs women? Last I checked the military still disallows women into combat situations. Also  this unit is undercover. Why? What possible reason would they have to be undercover? And they're not even good at it  I guess no one would realize that they were military if they didn't have on uniforms  BUT THEY WERE ALL CARRYING MACHINE GUNS (which incidentally change sound effects throughout the film  at some points sounding like air rifle BB guns  and at others  canons). There is one part when the Skeleton Man throws some construction workers from a catwalk  and you can clearly see the pad that they fall onto. At another point. Michael Rooker falls down a hill that is clearly flat ground. They tilted the camera slightly to give the appearance of an incline  but he is clearly pushing himself along in this looooooonnnnnggggggg fall scene. Then when he is helped back up the hill  the rope is flat  and when it shows the woman at the top of the hill the rope goes upward from her grip  not the way it would look if she was pulling someone up a hill. Rooker actually has a line that says  I'm not going after him  I going after it. What? That is quite possibly the dumbest thing I have ever heard  and I watch these bad movies as a hobby. The saddest part about this quote is that you can tell that everyone involved in the writing/production of this film thought that it was so bad-ass. Believe it or not  compared to the rest of the dialog  this is good.   The acting  bad. The makeup  really bad. These characters either had scars or wounds that liked to change sides of their face. Maybe these are alien scars that like to run around on your face. Yeah  I think I'll make a movie about that  Attack of the Alien Scars that Move Around on Your Face. That villain would be more intimidating than the Skeleton Man  and the film would probably be scarier.\n",

      "On my continuing quest to find the worst movie of all time  my friends and I stumbled upon this little gem. It is hilarious through and through  especially if you don't know (like we didn't) that it's a semi-sequel to another horror series.  I won't bother going into the plot except to mention that everyone complains about the horrible snowstorm that was coming (it was equivalent to the characters just screaming FORESHADOWING! at the camera and waving their arms)  and  in some odd twist of fate  the snow storm ever occurs. Budget problems  I guess.  Add that to a magical front door that is opened or closed depending on what scare effect the director wants to create and the electricity being cut off until the gym teacher decides to take a shower with lots of soap. I'll admit it; I had trouble breathing at points.  The only actual decent part of this movie  as it turns out  was from the original Slumber Party Massacre movie. It's so much funnier now that I know that.  *SPOILER* The end  where it is revealed that the slasher did it because her drunk friends stumbled in on her and a female friend making out and then the friend driving into a train or something is probably the funniest psycho killer origin ever  heightened by the fabulous use of blurring and stock footage. I'm glad all of the slasher's friends forgot the incident completely until a flashback was necessary.   Run  don't walk  to pick this up and see the hilarity. Of course  the continuity editor should be given an award for all of this  if only they weren't stuck in that horrible snow storm...\n",

      "This movie starts out with kids telling each other urban legends such as the poodle in the microwave and getting something extra at a chicken place. Unfortunately  it then turns to your basic anthology movie. The first being about a janitor with a bit of a secret. This one is okay at best. Then it gets worse as the next story about this kid obsessed with dead flies is on and it goes on and on and on. It is way to long and not all that interesting to begin with. After that you get the typical shock scene and it ends. You need more than this in an anthology movie.

      "Oh dear! What can I say about Half Past Dead? I was really disappointed in it. I was thinking....A Steven Seagal movie! Cool! We'll get to see him kick people and flip people and break bones. We might even get to see him have a stick fight with somebody! Excellent!  However  I was in for a rude awakening. This film can be summed up as follows:  Take an episode of the A-Team  remove the lovable and roguish characters such as Murdoch  Hannibal  Mr T and Face. Then get a writer/director to pen a plot even Ed Wood would be ashamed of and who's too big a fan of The Matrix and John Woo movies for his own good. Throw in a bunch of people with really bad acting ability and who don't have real names. Finally  add in a main star who's getting saggy around the midriff and doesn't appear to be able to do his own stunts anymore.   The result? Half Past Dead. An action movie so ridiculous that it at least made me smile right the way through. The plot holes are stupendously  glaringly large - for example  prisoners who  when the jail is invaded  fight the invaders rather than attempting to escape. Or how about the prison itself  which has an armoury that contains heavy machineguns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers? You also have a helicopter (bearing a striking resemblance to a Huey) with some kind of video game machinegun mounted in the nose.  Then there's Seagal himself. I like the guy. He CAN fight. He's even witty in a way that Jean-Claude Van Damme will never be. But all through the movie I kept hoping for that one great  defining fight scene. Never happened. Instead we got people firing guns a lot and not hitting a whole Hell of a lot. I mean  when someone runs down a narrow corridor and you fire a sub-machinegun at them  there isn't a whole lot of places the bullets can go other than down the corridor and into the target. Yet somehow they miss? Even the A-Team would cringe at this foolishness. And then when it gets to any kind of one-on-one physical stuff  we get treated to a shabby Matrix rip-off  without the benefit of bullet-time. People getting kicked twenty feet through the air and sundry other ludicrous acrobatic nonsense.  C'mon Steven  you're better than this. Your career can't be over. Say it ain't so!  This is instantly forgettable (except I'm forcing myself to remember for the purposes of this review) and if you watch it  try to find it amusing in an A-Team kind of way. But I doubt it'll be high on anyone's re-watchable list. Out for Justice this ain't. More like Out to Lunch.\n",

      "Let me first off say that I am a believer of ghosts  and I do indeed know they exist. I have had enough experiences with them to know they are there.  What I hate is the people who bring the Bible and Religion into all of this. People forget there is more than one Bible  thousands of religions and beliefs  and different ways to interpret what is said in the Bible. Not everyone believes in God  and not everyone believes in stereo-typical religion.   Religion does not make everything fact  one of the things I should mention in the Bible that many do not know is that even the most rampant Bible thumper is breaking the very rules written within....you are supposed to never wear more than one fabric at one time  slavery is OK  and you may murder your neighbor under certain circumstances. None of this  Oh that was the Old testament  and now we have the New Testament. If the Bible is the word of God  and cannot be changed..there should be no changes  or versions. Religion is full of misinterpretations  mixed facts  and people who so blindly follow it that there  Is no other way. The excuses these said blind followers use are either pathetic  or they themselves cannot explain the discrepancies properly  and instead use excuses handed down to them from either their Pastor or teacher.   But anyhow  onto the review. I am a decent fan of Ghost Hunters and when I heard this show was coming soon  I was pretty excited and thought it had some potential. As much as I like watching Ghost Hunters  I do not like some of their members  and I do not like the way they can dismiss a place as being haunted  yet cannot explain anything that is going on. Just because your investigation equipment does not pick it up  does not mean the camera filming the show did not. I am glad they are skeptical  but it's like they do not understand that just because you did not get anything on your recorder and film does not make the place haunted or not. If Ghosts were that easy to capture  it would be known as a fact  not a belief. It's more of a right place at the right time kind of thing  as well as if there is something there  what makes you think it's going to perform for you? This show is kind of silly. It's usually boring  and there is lots of talk  lots of psychics  yet hardly anything happens. The main guy's filtered narration is usually either boring to listen to  or is basically not needed.  Also  the reliance on psychics is too abundant  as I believe VERY few of them are actually gifted. Silvia Brown is one I definitely believe in  but most are sometimes hard to believe.  I really wanted to like this show  but of the few I have seen I have yet to be terribly impressed.\n",

      "If good intentions made a film great  then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made. The film has great actors  a master director  a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme  undertone of fifties existential world-weariness  aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination  and characters about which one might deeply care. It is about patriotism and about patriotism in a healthy way.  Not quite ten years after the film  I knew Air Force officers who taught my R.O.T.C. classes at university. They were intellectuals. They thought deeply about their work. They has senses of humor. One had been a crew member on the first plane to drop a hydrogen bomb. I have wondered if any one of them died in Vietnam. I imagine that they flew missions there.  Regrettably  the film fails. The movie lacks visual interest  drama  expression of feeling  and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative. No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie. Her Susan Holland is a woman that one would flee  not embrace. Col. James Stewart (who as then a colonel) makes a good stab at this role as Lt. Col(and later Col.) Dutch Holland. But the most interesting thing he does in the role is bite into a sandwich. I'm not kidding. Stewart was good as biting in sandwiches as he did in The Spirit of Saint Louis.   One might think of Ted Williams  but I don't when I watch Mr. Steward in the role. I do think of William Holden as Lt. Harry Brubaker in The Bridges at Toko-Ri . The comparison is not good for Mr. Stewart  who seems wasted in this film.  Footage shot from a B-36 looks like outtakes from commercials for an airline. Though beautiful  the aerial shots are mundane. For the time  they might have impressed viewers. The crash in Greenland involves unexciting modeling You expect the outcome to be good.  The undertone--the subtext-- for the film voices the tedium that Air Force flight crews must have felt during their long missions and the banality that the Air Force used to make its business--well business like any other business. One imagines how a La Nouvelle Vague director might explore this theme and then one begins to think about how someone with imagination might have filmed this movie. Little moments are missed.When crews returned from long missions  the members of the crew got a shot of scotch and a massage before debriefing the mission. Showing that might have helped.  Banality was the image the Air Force wanted and Mr. Mann accommodated the brass. Maybe  in that sense  the film works  but not for me.  I mourn when I watch the movie  because I think all of us  director  actors  crew  viewers  and members of the armed services might have enjoyed giving and getting much more than we get here.  I don't think that this movie had to be Dr. Strangelove or 2001  both of which it presages  but it had potential never realized. Yet  I enjoy watching it. I think of the airmen on their long missions and the ground crews in isolated places. There is a certain sense of honor celebrated here and I celebrate that honor.   I certainly understand why people who praise this movie here and other places appreciate it. If there were no intentional fallacy  it would get a 10 from me.  .\n",

      "This film is about a struggling actor trying to find satisfaction in life  especially love which he has not had a taste of for 5 years.  It basically is a film featuring a man with very poor social skills  and he says wrong things all the time. The plot is hollow and contrived. The main character  James  is lonely  but this theme of loneliness is not adequately explored. It is more like an empty statement which other subplots stem from. Sadness and disappointment after being dumped are superficial. There is a serious lack of emotions in the film.  It is not funny as a comedy either. There are some funny one liners but that is it. It lacks the happy and uplifting atmosphere to infect people with happy mood. I don't find I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With funny.\n",

      "After reading the book  Heart of Darkness  the movie did not do it justice. The movie puts the book to shame and anyone who has not experienced the book would frown upon the story and plot because it was portrayed so poorly by the movie. In the film  the characters and set were just some of the let downs that occurred in the movie. The director left out so many important and interesting aspects of the book that made it one of the best literary works ever made.  Of course any book is better than the movie but these weren't even comparable. Joseph Conrad as a writer was brilliant in vocabulary and the cleverness of the written word. The movie doesn't even start to show any of this. Some of the very important and influential scenes from the book were completely left out  like how Kurtz was not in the boat when he died. Also when Marlow went to deliver the news to Kurtz's intended  she reacted differently in the movie  rather than the book. Another major difference was that Marlow saw the picture of the lady that was blindfolded at the end of the movie  not at the beginning  like the book. This was influential on how the audience perceived Marlow  and the movie totally messed that up.  The book was so fine tuned on what every location looked like  but the scenery in the movie was a let down. There was a bunch of cheesy fake backgrounds and to compliment  a bunch of bad actors to go along with it. There was one exception to the awful actors and that would be Isaach De Bankolé  who played Mfumu. His character was depicted the best. Though the movie wasn't that great  I still would recommend it ONLY if you have read and understood the book very well. That way  you can see what the differences are in the movie and book and contemplate them. If you have not read the book  I do not recommend the movie because it is a boring  lifeless mess. I loved the book  so you should definitely read it and enjoy it.\n",

      "Evan Almighty continues the mainstream Bruce Almighty franchise  this time with newsman turned freshman Congressman from Buffalo  Evan Baxter (Steve Carell)  at it's center. A wholly innocuous (and not even really self-doubting) man  God (Morgan Freeman) decides to enforce some sort of quest upon Baxter  in order to illustrate the importance of... reciprocal kindness  so that Baxter can change the world (aka  pay it forward).  Think of Evan Almighty as a wholesome derivative of 'Distinguished Gentlemen.' Baxter is not a con  but his colleague  Congressman Long (John Goodman) wants his unquestioned support on a bill that essentially  is harmful to the environment. And well-meaning Baxter  knowing the importance of networking and visibility  is willing to support him.   In addition  with the new job comes more responsibility  and Baxter is in a sense  vilified  for not spending enough time with his family.   So God  decides to give Evan Baxter some guidance by forcing him to become the modern day Noah. His orders: build an ark. Except  while it may be mildly humorous to see Baxter's transformation to the weirdo with a beard-o  there doesn't seem to be much point to this whole thing which becomes abundantly clearer when the climax of the film fizzles. (SPOILERS: if none of the population is killed by the flood  then what was the point of summoning the animals... or at least the ones that obviously weren't from suburban Virginia? or  more importantly  if all Baxter had to realize was that Long's projects faltered in their quality  then why did he have to build an ark?).  So  although a comedy like this needn't be a hysterical laugh-riot  it was certainly one made far less enjoyable as it was crammed with far too many homilies (and not all from Morgan Freeman) and action that seemed intended for a film of more epic events.\n",

Like in the beginning  the part where the monk dude shoved the arrow into his own hand  then shot that same arrow into the gargoyle five minutes later--no sense whatsoever.  The only thing worse than the plot line is the CGI  which would be greatly rivaled by a homemade flash movie. The actors look like they're doing their hardest to portray a bunch of 70's robots; the dialogue makes so little sense it's not funny.  Many things just HAPPEN with no explanation as to how or why  such as a lady suddenly wandering around a zoo that had shut down hours ago. And when she sees this THING flying towards her  her first reaction is to take a picture  rather than what she does a full ten minutes later---power-walking (not even running) like her life depended on it--which  obviously  it doesn't.

      "I am a big fan of Deepa Mehta's work  especially Fire and Earth 1947. Unfortunately  this movie of hers lacks _all_ that is needed for a good film.  The movie attempts to showcase the plight of the widows in India in the early 20th century and the new wave of ideas of their rehabilitation around the same time. Shown with a child widow as a central character  although the plot too banal from an Indian standpoint  it could still have been a very powerful movie. Alas! the movie lacked both the sensitivity of Fire and the intensity of emotion in Earth 1947.  Even if one assumes that the story is a given  although there are hundreds of things I would have liked different in that as well  the movie making is especially unfortunate. Everything is said. Everything is shown straight. Absence of sensitive implied sentences. Absence of things left unsaid. I just couldn't believe that this was a Deepa Mehta film.  There were some very standard Hindi movie characters - like an old widow with her own vested interests  or a father who has double standards of the highest quality. Can one not write a script without having these old-style standard Indian movie characters?  Many people acclaimed Deepa for making a movie and proving a point against hindu fundamentalists. Well  I agree that she took a bold step  but should one not worry about the quality of movie  or is it being a controversial one an end in itself? Its obvious  that if you start with a story as in Water  you will end up feeling the pain of the widows in consideration --- It doesn't take an accomplished director to achieve that. And the movie had nothing more than that!! So where is Deepa's contribution to the film?  And talk about acting etc. - pathetic!!! Lisa Ray has a pretty face  an extremely pretty face - but thats where it ends. She can't speak Hindi; she can't emote. John Abraham is no better. Most widows seem unnatural. The saving grace are Seema Biswas and the young girl. They are fabulous.  And this was a period film - but the Hindi dialogues suck big time. Even there utterance is also as unnatural as it gets. No rustic accents!!! No local slangs. No nothing. The only thing right was probably the shooting locales. I thought that the set of the vidhwa-ashram was reasonably real. The overall blue tinge in the whole movie is also apt.  But all and all  don't watch this movie. You _won't_ get anything. There is nothing in the story  or direction. If you have to watch it watch it for the little girl's acting.\n",

      "I saw this movie a while ago and I was looking forward to it. My biggest problem was having seen the trailer I was expecting a very stylish marshal arts movie with plenty of action and maybe a bit of plot to think about along the way. I was sorely disappointed as it would seem that once you have seen the trailer there is nothing else worth watching (if what you are expecting is as described above). My girlfriend at the time gave up half way through and whilst I continued to watch in the hope that something interesting might happen... nothing did. I found no attachment or real interest in any of the characters. I would say just don't bother unless you have a few hours of your life that you don't really care about losing.\n",

      "I don't care what anyone says  this movie was crap. The only thing it had going for it was camera work which was very well done. As for the dialogue I have heard so many people talk about...it sucked too. Yes it was honest and true to life  but so what  I can hear anyone talk like that on the street  or in a fast food joint. What made the dialogue good in movies like Pulp Fiction  and Gosford Park was the fact that it is WRITTEN dialogue  that takes time to think through. Another thing was that the director should not have put himself in the picture. I believe that the male character could have been a lot stronger  but instead it seemed weak. In fact the movie seemed to revolve around the male character  and then he completely disappears in the last twenty minutes. The girl in the film I found completely repulsive  not in appearance  but in her needy needy ways. Saying she is in love with a guy  and actually getting jealous of him the next day  what a crock of crap. Final thing: the sound was terrible  and I hope it was only something that plagued my theater instead of actually being on the final cut of the film. There was a constant buzzing sound during several scenes and it was actually taking away from the talking going on. The one good thing again was Blood's job as the DP  but the actress that played the main guy's ex girlfriend did a very good job as well. These two things couldn't save an ultimately terrible movie  which I refuse to call a film.   2/10\n",

      "Overall  the movie Heart of Darkness was pitiful compared to the book. Anyone who has ever read the book and had a sufficient understanding of it would be able to see the countless obvious flaws. There is an immeasurable difference between the two. It seems to me that the director was walking into a losing battle. I couldn't imagine that someone would take on the monstrous task of recreating Heart of Darkness. The immense detail and magic of the story would be impossible to justly interpret. Conrad's story had so many layers and so much depth that it would seem pointless to try to make a visual interpretation.  First  capturing the details of the story is unattainable. The colossal fine points created by Joseph Conrad cannot be rightfully recreated through film. Marlow's feelings and emotions cannot be equally construed in the movie. If you have taken on the enormous task of tackling Conrad's work then  you know as well as I that Conrad only wrote half the story. The additional half is a series of connections made by the reader. You  as the reader are required to be capable of inferring and connecting Joseph Conrad's ideas. As a result  several crucial details are absent in the movie.  Also  although the movie was an adequate length  the film seemed short. It seemed that Conrad was able to pack many more details into 75 pages than the movie could pack in an hour and a half. The speed of the movie kept the viewer from getting to know the characters. Marlow was much more of a stranger. The viewpoint of the book puts you into Marlow's shoes. However  in the movie  you're almost watching Marlow from a distance. I began to think that the director was trying to utilize the same read between the lines method as Conrad did. However  the connections were weak. I know that if I had not read the book then  I would  in no way  be able to begin to understand the depth of the situation and the characters.  Finally  Kurtz also seemed to be interpreted incorrectly. His role was short and the details weren't all included. It was impossible to comprehend the true Kurtz in the length of time he was shown. An important detail in the book was that Kurtz had become a god to the Africans. I didn't think that significant detail was defined. Also  in the book  Kurtz represented a soulless being. He had died inside long ago. I believe the director comprehended this detail. However  instead of recreating it  he just had Kurtz mope around and mumble everything. Moreover  it seemed like the director attempted to make Kurtz seem mysterious  however  instead  he seemed entirely unidentified.  Altogether  this movie reminded me of a teenager cramming to finish a science project  due the next day. It appeared to have been crafted effortlessly and in hardly any time. The characters were alienated  crucial details were left out  and  overall  the central plot was lost in translation.\n",

      "Unlike what one reviewer said this is NOT a ripoff of Magnum Force. In that one Lieutenant Hal Holbrook put together his own little squad from Academy rookies to dispatch repeat offenders. In Extreme Justice this operation has the sanction from the higher ups of the LAPD. Just how far they sanction the exact methods used is open to question.   This Special Investigations Squad seems to be quite the haven for the misfits of the LAPD  those that have forgotten their first duty is protection and service. Which is why Scott Glenn thinks Lou Diamond Phillips  a detective with more than his share of beefs with Internal Affairs for excessive use of force  is perfect for the squad.  What should have sent him running from Phillips is the fact he's got a nice live-in relationship with a reporter  Chelsea Field. That one certainly threw me in this film  you'd think that Lou would be the last guy he'd try to recruit for his team.  And what his team is  is a death squad. They target perpetrators follow them and wait to catch them in the act. Then it's open season.  Extreme Justice went very overboard in trying to make a point. There sure would have been no harm in waiting for a gang of bank robbers to finish the robbery and taking them down outside. No civilians got hurt when the citizens of Coffeyville did that to the Daltons. Or waiting until three rapists finish the job before moving in. That's what were asked to believe here.  And frankly I couldn't buy it. A lot of good players get really wasted in this one.\n",

      "The final frames of the original American Graffiti provide one-line summaries of the fates of the film's four central male characters. While somewhat sexist in omitting the female characters  the ending of the original film provided all the information about those people that even the most ardent fan of the movie would want. However  someone felt that mega-bucks could be made by detailing the dreary lives of these characters after the original film ended. Bad move. Making an insurance salesman and his wife  a nerdy private in Vietnam  a drag race driver  and a overgrown hippie into interesting characters in interesting situations was far beyond the talents of those who wrote this nearly unwatchable movie. While most of the original cast is back  with only Richard Dreyfuss having the good sense to stay away  More American Graffiti is a mess of silly situations that involve protests  car races  country singers  and the Vietnam war. The use of split screens  once thought innovative and daring  is overused here to the point of distraction and adds confusion to the already confused goings one. This is a sequel that demonstrates nearly everything that can go wrong with a sequel. Perhaps it should be screened in film schools as a lesson. Even the use of period music  which was a delight in the original  is poorly done here. If you want more American Graffiti  see the original twice.\n",

      "Pretty lousy made-for-TV sequel to the Roman Polanski classic. Rosemary's son Adrian has grown up and is embodied by creepy Stephen McHattie. After eliminating Rosemary (here played by Patty Duke) a coven of witches  again led by Minnie & Roman Castevets  preps Satan's son for world domination. It's not really scary and light years less macabre than its predecessor. Instead  writer Anthony Wilson and director Sam O'Steen opt for a Satan-worshiping thriller full of a lot of chanting  plenty of candles  and Ruth Gordon trying to act daffy and nasty at the same time. Gordon's the sole holdover from the original. George Maharis replaces John Cassavetes as Guy and a very hammy Ray Milland plays Roman Castevets  subbing for the late Sidney Blackmer. Newcomer McHattie is the film's only real saving grace. He's very off-kilter and looks really sinister without even doing anything. The music by Charles Bernstein is suitably creepy  but so over-used  it's ends up being intrusive rather than effective. O'Steen  who edited the earlier Polanski masterpiece  shows no flair or subtlety whatsoever.\n",

      "I see that C. Thomas Howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the 80s as an accomplished young actor.  I bought this DVD because it was cheap and in part for the internet-related plot and to see how much older C. Thomas Howell is; I do not recall seeing him in any movies since the 1980s.  In just a few words: what a very big disappointment. I give some low budget movies a chance  but this one started out lame. Within the first 15 minutes of the movie  this elusive woman is chatting with an Asian guy in a chatroom. They basically stimulate themselves to their own chat  she then insists on meeting the participant in person. She meets him  has sex  ties him up and then murders him in cold blood. The plot then deteriorates further.  The plot is thin and flimsy and the acting is very stiff. Do not bother renting it much less purchasing it  even if it is in the $1 DVD bin. I plan to take my copy of the DVD to Goodwill. I am truly amazed that any of the prior reviewers here gave this movie a bad rating.\n",

      "I am very diplomatic in my reviews  and as an academic writer  try to give creative license to TV writers trying to explicate a true story. This story  about Karen Carpenter  could have helped so many  yet due to the directing and editing  does not.  The story  in this case  is not fully addressed  unless one reads psychological journals. While Cynthia Gibb portrays a realistic Karen  it is sad that so much has been edited...Louise Fletcher portrays her mother  and does an excellent job  with limited material and dialogue. In this case  I give the actors credit for surviving this project.  Why is the audience not permitted to see causation factors?....American audiences are quite savvy  and if they have cable  usually educated.  I sincerely feel that I could have written a better story  would not have edited out the truth  and allowed the actors to project the reality.  Richard Carpenter  as director  has seriously underestimated and insulted American audiences. Karen's story is important  and it is sad we will never hear it.\n",

      "I saw this movie when it first came to the theaters in 1988 and though I knew it wasn't of award winning caliber...I kinda liked it. It tales the tale of 5 former cub scouts reuniting to take on the one task they never got to finish as kids - which is to climb Mt. Whitehead. Of course now the cub scouts are all grown up and have developed their personalities in a variety of ways  but none too differently than they were as children. Richard Lewis is still neurotic  Richard Belzer is still a playboy  Franklyn Ajaye is still sort of the Dear Abby of the group  and Tim Thomerson is still the surfer dude of the group. Of course the top billed star is Louie Anderson  a true believer in everything Cub Scout related. He still lives in the same house with his mother  still goes over the Cub Scout manual daily  is brave  reverent and clean  and is the one who reunites the others for one more grand adventure in Scouting. Compounding their task  however  is the Grunski brothers  two bullies drummed out of the Cub Scouts by the above mentioned. By coincidence they run into their old den and decide to harass them a bit  albeit harmlessly. Not so harmlessly is three escaped convicts  who think Pack 7 is from the FBI and are intent on wiping them out. All in all  the movie still has bits of charm. Observe Richard Lewis trying to get comfortable on a folding cot  for example  and you have a really funny bit going for you. Upon further review  the entire film needed more of that type of observational humor. It doesn't hold up well after all these years but still remains a guilty pleasure.\n",

I was impressed by the amount of suspense there was; I HAD actually expecting that to be chucked out the window in favor of gore  gore  gore. It wasn't  but there's some pretty ridiculous deaths.  The thing that I disliked  however  was all of the plot complications. Those could have been okay  if the scriptwriters had taken the time to explain all of them through. But what was the purpose of the secret society in the mental institution  specifically? Why were they protected from Michael's damage until a certain point? What exactly were they going to do with the baby? How did Jaime Lloyd get pregnant  for that matter? Why lock her up for 20 years for her to get pregnant  too? Why did Michael kill all his co-conspirators in the end? Why were there fetuses in the lab? The actors seemed to have figured it all out once they saw the fetuses.. But it was never explained to the audience.  If you're just going to watch this film to see people get snuffed  then this'll be okay for you.. However  if you can't stand a plot being thrown at you which remains unresolved by the time the credits roll  you should go watch something else.\n",

      "For reasons I cannot begin to fathom  Dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco) begins injecting wolf's blood into his dim-witted handyman  Petro (Glenn Strange). The result  Petro is transformed into a hideous (as hideous as someone with a bad wig and pointy teeth can be) killer beast. Dr. Cameron uses Petro to get his revenge against those in the scientific community who scoffed at and ridiculed his ideas (and why wouldn't they  Dr. Cameron's nuttier than a fruitcake).  Overall  The Mad Monster is one dull and poorly made Poverty Row thriller. There's really only one positive I can come up with to write about in The Mad Monster. George Zucco can be fun to watch as he plays the mad scientist about as well as anyone. His Dr. Cameron is a regular loony. He has no qualms about killing; he has entire conversations with people who aren't there; and  as with most mad scientists  he messes in God's domain (actually  I'm not sure anyone accuses him of this  but it fits). But beyond Zucco  there's nothing here to recommend. Everything else from the monster effects to the supporting cast to the music is plain old bad. There are far better examples of Poverty Row horror from the 1940s than The Mad Monster.\n",

      "I couldn't relate to this film. I'm surprised that people are lauding it for being so 'realistic'. How many people at your school were victim to incest? How many closet homosexual jocks were there? How many quiet people that you never noticed committed suicide? Hmmm. OK you wouldn't know even if their were. But really these are explosive problems which many us never deal with. And yet there are so many teenagers with subtle problems which could have been explored. But hey  where's the 'entertainment' in that?  With regards to the girl who committed suicide - I found this to be exploitative. I actually think MANY people in High School at some stage feel invisible  ignored and unwanted. But what possesses someone to violently commit suicide on just another day of being ignored and unnoticed? The filmmaker decided this girl would suicide to make the film more provocative. And the graphic nature of the suicide to make it even more provocative. I didn't buy it as a real life scenario.  And the problems of the other students I didn't fully relate to. Bullying is explored but that's been done to death  we all know it goes on and it truly is a matter of resolve within that person. Closet homosexuality? Pfft  another cliché gets rolled out. Thats the thing really  too many clichés. I guessed the ending at the start. There was a predictable unpredictability if that makes sense. You've got all these characters with explosive problems  and one with apparently none. And I thought  what is the point of this character unless she's the unsuspecting suicide victim? And surely enough..  One thing I will say  and it is the saving grace of the film  is that it does NOT glamourise suicide. The suicide is very graphic and heart-breaking to watch. It is a powerful scene (regardless of how contrived it is)and one that dismisses suicide as the easy option. But the film is really not very imaginative and used stereotypes.  Not bad but certainly not groundbreaking OR worthy of a 17-minute standing ovation at Cannes???\n",

      "Pretty terrible  but not entirely unwatchable. Another review mentioned predictable - and that's almost an understatement. You can make a game out of guessing what the next line will be. Every character is either stereotype or archetypical. The good guy in a bad situation  the struggle between older and younger priest on acceptance and discipline  the repressed  sexually/emotionally deprived woman returning to the small town after failing in the big city  engaged to the hotheaded  feeble minded beau from youth  the unredeemable bad guys  two lost boys looking for a sense of family - they're all here  and none of them with even the remotest spin of something new. From the first few minutes you can figure out exactly what will happen by film's end. The story isn't entirely lame  but direction  acting (even from a cast with some talent) everything is thrown together without skill. As to the storyline  we've all seen it before in a movie called Sister Act. This is also one of those films where inattention to small details show up in an even more glaring light. (As example: the nurse and our hero drive into town but park several blocks away from their destinations (post office and hardware store) - yet both walk across empty parking lots for no apparent reason. Or the passage of morning to night during a scene that seemingly should occur in no more than half an hour. The movie is filled with that kind of stuff and then tags on an improbable denouement.\n",

      "Let me get this straight:  Hotshot plastic surgeon loses a patient on the operating table while removing a cyst from her face and ends up falling in love with recently separated bed and breakfast hostess within about 24 hours of meeting her due to her solid advice on bedside manner.  Wow. Move over The Notebook  there's a new kid in town.  Where to begin. Well  how about the depth of this relationship? I think we can safely sum up the foundation of this undying love in the following steps:  1. Exchange polite pleasantries over a bite of salad. 2. Drink copious amounts of Jack Daniels; play basketball with old food 3. Provide glib  unsolicited advice to each other on your crappy lives. 4. Make love during a hurricane. 5. Devote your lives to each other via airmail.  I noticed George C Wolfe has The Hairball and United Kanye West Project in his dossier. Would stick to your genre be too harsh? Enough said. I think most would agree that the best love stories make us cry  or laugh or even hope. But the reason they are able to do that is that  somewhere during the storyline  we really start to care about the characters we're watching on screen. To make us care  there must be time spent developing these characters...their lives  their history  why we're watching them now. Wolfe didn't seem to want to waste our time with such trivialities  and instead provided us with all of about 8 minutes of background information on each character before hurling us into an intense one-on-one interaction between two ACTORS we've all come to adore  but two CHARACTERS we could care less about.  For one brief tender moment when Richard Gere exclaims that he doesn't expect her to listen to his problems  and she invites him for dinner  the viewer sees a glimmer - a beginning - of something special between these two characters. But instead of being allowed to enjoy the anticipation and playfulness of what happens next in the wonderful  unpredictable joy that is courtship  we are instead pushed headlong into a love affair between two people we hardly know.  Let's face it. We have all heard cheesy one liners in Romantic films. But the reason we cut some slack to Bogart in Casablanca or Nicholson in Something's Gotta Give is because our hearts and minds have been lifted to the heavens and dragged through the mud and back again with these characters  and by the time they deliver the line  we're so deeply involved with their plight  we don't even notice the cheese factor. Since Wolfe doesn't allow us to love or even like our protagonists  all we're left with a fromage sandwich and a few snickers in the audience.  Wolfe takes the old Hollywood director's phrase cut to the chase much too literally here. As each stilted one liner is delivered by our cast  the viewer is left wondering if director Wolfe is subliminally saying to the audience: c'mon. it's a Richard Gere romance. just buy in.  It is as a result of this stunning lack of character - or relationship - development that the film's climax fails miserably to tug at our hearts. When Gere's character dies  I felt like I was watching the news about someone I didn't know passing away. Or watching a ladies' eights rowing race during the beijing olympics. Just. Didn't. Care.  Epic. Fail.\n",

The trouble is that there is so much going on it feels as though writer director Richard Kelly didn't know what sort of movie he was making.

Is this Invasion of the Body Snatchers or a demonic take over film? Don't know  maybe. And that's the problem there are lots of questions  most of them intriguing  but there are too many. Little seems to have been explained and when we get to the end of the film things seem more to stop then to conclude (even in an open ended way).

It made me crazy.

      "This unintentionally amusing mid-80s TV movie is based on the premise that sex bomb Donna Mills (in a mostly appalling wardrobe throughout) is a neglected housewife  pining for her sexy past as a cheerleader. She escapes her empty life by fantasising about random sexual encounters with one of the many attractive men she comes across  finally giving into her fantasies and indulging in a bit on the side  although all she really wants is to reignite the flames of passion with her boring husband James Brolin.  There are many laughable aspects to this film  Mills' first foray into co-producing (later  following her departure from Knots Landing  she found great success as a trashy TV movie queen starring in mostly issue-of-the-week melodramas through most of the '90s - she usually played a victim of some sort  clearly determined to wash her hands of the wonderfully wicked and entertaining conniver she played for so long on Knots). Funniest are the drawn-out fantasy sequences  filmed as though they are meant to be soft-core porn (wind and smoke machines  backlighting  porno music)  but as this is a network TV movie the scenes are all very chaste and ultimately not very sexy at all. The most amusing (and bizarre) scene has Mills taking a walk on the wild side downtown among the spiky-haired punks (complete with Robert Palmer soundtrack).   Less laughable is the dreadful dialogue that the cardboard characters are forced to utter (pity poor Cicely Tyson as the mandatory psycho-analyst  or Veronica Cartwright as the mandatory best friend  or even pre-Babs James Brolin with that daytime soap style of clenched fist anger.)  Of course  as in all of these sorts of films  we learn that all problems can be solved through psycho-therapy and then the film just becomes silly  as we explore  briefly  the reasons for Mills' shocking behaviour (as if it can't just be that she wants a good shag!)

      "George Cukor's The Women remains one of the glittering gems of 1939  Hollywood's most golden of golden years. The film crackled and sparked and it's absence of males was a subtle touch  hardly noticed because of all the fine entertainment.  Flash forward. We see Fifth Avenue in New York City  in front of Saks. Large crowds bustle along the Avenue...but something's off. The shot reveals only well dressed (attractive and young) women. Creepier than I Am Legend  the visual concept continues  inside the store and later at a large fashion show. What NYC fashion show doesn't have at least 5 gay men? The no men rule is rammed down our throats creating an alien world  off balance and distracting.  Enter Meg Ryan  first seen digging in her garden wearing a ridiculous get-up complete with her retro curls and flailing arms. I immediately sympathized with her husband and could understand why he looked elsewhere. Later in the film she morphs into an older Jennifer Aniston look and keeps her arms at her sides. This seems intentional as if to say Look! I can still be relevant! Ryan's character is loaded down with a coven of miss-matched friends (insert Sex and the City comparison here) who  if it were real life  would despise each other. Annette Bening plays the power bitch  who during the course of the film realizes her life's dream doesn't really make her happy. Jada Pinkett Smith is the power lesbian  all atitudinous with no use for any of the men who aren't there. Debra Messing is some sort of baby factory that eats a lot. Eva Mendes is an odd choice for the bad girl to say the least. She looks fake  acts fake and any humor she tries to demonstrate falls flat. Someone's comment on here that she looked trans-gender was spot on. Other various stars show up  to rearrange the furniture on this Titanic.  The only thing that would have saved this would have been the brilliant casting of Jennifer Aniston and Angelina Jolie. They could have named their price  tucked their tongues firmly into their cheeks and pulled off something very clever and profitable. But no  Hollywood thinks of itself way too highly for that kind of exploitation. Instead we're given this thing that lumbers along awkwardly with no sparkle. Entire sections of dialog from the original are lifted and plopped down into a scene with awful results. At one point Ryan exclaims something along the lines of  This isn't a 1930's movie! No Meg  it's not.\n",

      "I saw this movie with very low expectations. I didn't know a lot about it so I wasn't sure if it was going to be worth it.  The story did an OK job of getting you curious about these ruins they travel to. The suspense continues when the Mayans show up and force them to stay at the ruins.  Then the movie turns from somewhat suspenseful to pointless. The amount of gore found in this movie did not balance out compared to whether it was truly necessary or used more for shock value.  The fact that they didn't make any attempt to fight the vines from hell. They had fire and didn't try to burn it nor did they try to cut it with a knife to see if they could destroy it or not. They quickly jumped into a victim role and their helpless attitude was not real. It reminded me of the old horror movies where the people just scream and yell and don't have half a brain to try to fight back.\n",

      "Well...I like Patricia Kaas. She is a beautiful lady and an extremely gifted and versatile singer. Her acting in this film is more than competent and from my point of view about the only redeeming feauture of this film. She very gently captures the essence of the lonely singer with a very serious helath problem. However what I tremendously dislike about the film is the shameless product placement for a well known French chain of hotels. The other thing is that the story seems to meander for way to long without really deciding what the film is about and what it wants to be. On a positive note you may argue that the film is not predictable but you could also say it's plainly boring because of the lack of cohesion. There are some nice shots in the film bujt you can't help thinking that all the parts just don't add up to anything at all. It really is a pity bevcause Kaas really shines in this film.\n",

The audience has to wait around the whole movie for the guilty to be caught. The result is like every single episode of Columbo or murder she wrote. The director himself refers to the hackney story by showing the police officer watching an episode of Matlock! This story barely fills up 90 minutes but the director insists on using all 120 minutes filling with every cliche in the book. Skip this one  you are not missing anything.\n",

      "The comments already left for this show are way more funny than the show itself and they are all accurate. I feel exactly the same way  that I am very disappointed at how far Rick Mercer has fallen when he used to do some really great things on This Hour Has 22 Minutes but now he is just clowning around  going places and talking to people. He does some bits in the studio about things going on in the news but they are never funny at all  just really sad and predictable jokes about headlines. Most of his show is him going somewhere to talk to people  for example this week he is going to a rodeo and the video pieces are all of him making funny faces and acting scared of the wild horses  etc. He used to be funny but has gotten way less funny since leaving This Hour Has 22 Minutes and that show is also not funny at all any more. Now that Air Farce is off the air (finally thank goodness!) Mercer and This Hour Has 22 Minutes have got to be next in line for the axe  just old tired predictable comedy that almost nobody finds funny any more. It's sad really considering Rick Mercer used to be the funniest man on Canadian TV!\n",

      "I'm seeing a pattern here. If you see a movie on Mystery Science Theater 3000  chances are if you go to IMDb.com there will be hordes of lovers of the film  yet it was picked to be on that TV show because it was sooo bad. I'm sorry but I read a lot about Rocketship X-M as being some landmark sci fi film that stressed realism. Well if that is the case I could write for several paragraphs about how even with 1950's knowledge this movie is utterly flawed. Gravity might be the first obvious observation  or as MST3K did as a skit selective gravity  also what about when they are plunging to their death and they are just standing there looking out of the window  um would'nt the ship being upside down effect that scene? I would like to think that they started with good intentions and that it ran over budget or something but I think this movie was just plain cheese as in the from under type. Just compare this to When Worlds Collide which was released in 1951 to see the true place where this movie ranks  there's no comparison. The movie gets a 2 or maybe 3 on its own  its not even funny to watch on its own. It gets about a 5 or 6 as a MST3K episode as there is no action or much to make fun of  just bad  bad  bad  oh did I mention  it's bad.\n",

      "European films may be slower-paced and less plot driven than American films  but this takes it way too far. It also show a whole bunch of incompletely drawn characters doing inexplicable things. It's not fantasy  it's not even surreal  it's just awkward and bad.  What's the message here? That people in France are pensive and gaze morosely a lot? That they like to watch other people having sex? They they spontaneously scream or touch a stranger on his neck? Do not wear a watch when seeing this film  as you will be astonished at how little is explained or learned over huge stretches of time.  This is the story of a police superintendent who is deeply troubled by the brutal murder of a little girl  though actually he seems troubled before then. He is not merely upset at his own personal tragedies  but apparently mentally quite slow  behaving very much like a learning-disabled six-year old child. He stares blankly a lot  walks with arms rigid like a little kid  speaks in meek  simpering  tones  behaves quite oddly in all of his interactions (though no one seems to notice or care  even when it is supposed to be police business). He's not a troubled cop  more of an outpatient. Picture Andy Kaufman's Latka character on Taxi  but without the humor. He is not only not believable as a policeman he is not believable as an adult. That he won an award for this interpretation of his character is truly amazing -- unless he was playing the part exactly as written and the fault lies with the weirdos who scripted this thing. The plot is clearly secondary. Do not expect to see anything remotely like what police would do if a little girl was found murdered. This not that important  though the implausibility of their behavior is sort of insulting. The problem is that the rest of the film makes no sense either. That leaves the long lingering close-ups of fields  vegetable gardens  people's faces etc. The ending struck me as especially ridiculous -- totally unsupported by the events leading up to it -- unless you think  What's the worst way this film could end?  There is lots of sex and nudity  which is supposed to mean something. You want vaginas? You'll see vaginas. Not to worry  it's art. It has deep meaning  what I am not sure. And the protagonist  despite his innocent weirdness  seems to have some sort of homoerotic neck or jowl fetish.  Finally  the subtitles are in white and frequently appear on a white background -- very hard to read many of them. On the other hand  there isn't much dialogue  so this isn't a big problem. There is also very little sound -- not even ambient sounds you would expect to hear -- in the film  contributing to the emptiness of the whole experience. The old Woody Allen would have had a field day parodying this work.  That this is an award-winning film is sad. I would hate to see the losing films.  Enjoy.\n",

      "First off  the editing of this film consisted of one major flaw which I don't understand how was missed - you consistently see the overhead microphones bobbing in and out of the film. The first time I saw it I just said well  mistakes happen and brushed it off. After about the 10th time  it began to get incredibly irritating and distractingly funny. If you haven't seen the film yet  try counting how many times you see the microphone; might make for pretty interesting game.  Now  about the film. This movie started out with the makings of a pretty solid ghost story; however  the plot twist at the end just ruined it completely. You begin watching the movie under the assumption  alluded by the TV commercials  that the haunted house consists of ghosts which can only be seen by children; particularly young children  which makes it even more freaky as they will be unable to effectively warn the family of the impending danger. The opening scene did a good job of misleading the audience that this would remain the premise of the film. **(SPOILER)** The movie starts with the family being stalked and ultimately killed by an unseen force in the home. The idea that only children can see these ghosts is set in motion when the daughter  at the beginning of the movie  asks her little brother to tell her where it is right before it grabs her and drags her screaming into the cellar. The young boy also witnesses this supposedly unseen force kill his mother after she tells him to hide under the bed. After his family is killed  the boy attempts to run and hide only to be snatched away as well.  As I said  this movie started out with the makings of a pretty spooky movie in which the family would be stalked by an unseen force with their only hopes of survival resting on sightings by a two-year-old. This began to be ruined less than halfway into the film as the daughter began to see the ghosts as well; completely ruining the only children can see illusion set forth by the commercials and opening scene.  Regardless of this  the movie didn't actually get ruined until the plot twist at the end. In which the man who had been helping the family cultivate the farm turns out to have been the man responsible for killing the family at the beginning of the movie. All of a sudden  after being attacked by a swarm of crows  the man snaps and tries to kill the mother  daughter  and son while having a psychotic breakdown in which he believes them to be HIS family; which he killed at the beginning.  The whole plot twist at the end just created a whole list of unsolved questions and left me going wtf. First  why was the family's souls trapped in a house? If the director was going for a Ju-On (The Grudge) approach in which the family  after dying in a fit of rage  would haunt the house and kill whoever enters  why did the haunting stop after the father was captured by the ghosts of his family? If the ghosts only wanted to kill the man that killed them  why were they attacking the new family? Here's another one for you. It takes several months from the time you sow seeds until the plants fully blossom in time for harvest. This tells me that the man who killed his family at the beginning  the man that the ghosts apparently had a grudge with the whole movie  was living on the property for months. During all this time  why didn't the ghosts just go kill him?   This movie included a lot of clichéd horror movie scares as well as an obvious combination of ideas from other horror movies. However  I'm telling ya  this movie still could've pulled off okay if not for the plot twist at the end. It's like they just ran out of their budget and just threw together something for an ending. For this movie to have been a success  they should've stuck with the only children can see them premise and ended with either the family barely getting away or being killed off like the family at the beginning (would've opened the door for possible sequel too).\n",

      "Hopper has never been worse as if he felt as this movie is worthy of only a grade B performance and he delivers a rather good one. Outside of Madsen and Hopper the acting is horrid; you've seen better at your local high school. The sound and at times the editing and camera shots are low end of B-movies. The scene with the peeping tom is of movies greatest gratuitous nudity scenes I've ever seen (it doesn't even come close to fitting in the movie). The script was probably a great 10-page outline  but when it comes out to a full-length movie there are more holes in it then the dead bodies Madsen left behind.

      "First off  the first thing that came to my mind after I finished this film last night was Why the title of 8MM 2?  because I saw the first one obviously  and what did this have to do with the first movie's plot? The only thing that was similar was the fact that the couple had to go into the porno industry and that wasn't even needed in the plot  because after you see the ending that I will not spoil  it just didn't make any sense.  A diplomat and his fiancée are in Hungary and notice a woman who is swimming naked in the pool area  she's very attractive  so when they see her at a club  they decide to have a little fun and have a steamy threesome. But things get extremely intense when the diplomat is mailed pictures of them all having the affair  fearing that it might go public and jeopardize his career  they pay off the guy who sent the pictures  the diplomat freaks out and kills the guy  leading into a murder case. He and his fiacee decide to find the girl they had the affair with  but things just get deeper and darker as they go further into what they got themselves into.  What could have been an alright thriller  turned into an unexplained and not well thought out movie  which was sad. Like I said  the title really has nothing to do with the first one  so don't fall for it. It's just a sexual thriller that makes no sense  but it's good for those nights alone  because quite frankly this is one of those films where it's so close to porn that it might as well be labeled as soft core.  4/10\n",

In the event  it is what it says on the box  no more nor less: low level humour  crudity  very much in the 'Carry On...' vein but with 'adult' language. Indeed  it harks back to the 60s/70s UK porn industry  cheating punters by promising real sex and not delivering (spot the nipple?) That whole tawdry era is lovingly recreated here but with modern cinematography.  It has the benefit of Mackenzie Crook (The Office  Pirates of the Caribbean and much more) and also Johnny Vegas. The chip shop girl is genuinely sexy. Beyond these unexpected positives  it does leave me wondering what happened to England. Junk food  low paid work  council estates  desperate lives. As a bonus  there are some nice shots of leafy Birmingham. Foreigners might find it informative about British attitudes and aspirations.

      "One of the worse gay-related movies I have ever seen. Since these are not characters in this story it's hard to comment on the actual film. Therefore  since Colton Ford (aka Glen) laid his life open for all to see  I guess he's fair game to criticize. And that's not hard to do. Here goes. 50 something Glen is a big time porn star who wants fame and fortune as a big time singer. (I guess 11 films makes him a star) Being gay and forty  I have seen porno and I did not recognize him or his lover. Personally they all look the same to me with different hair styles. Face it  guys  he's no Jeff Stryker  Jim Bently or Casey Donovon. That's OK  though. The purpose of these films takes place in about 6.5 minutes  so they all pretty much have the same requirements  if you know what I mean.  So Glen wants to be a serious (legit) singer after he dumps the porno industry but he can't get anyone to take him seriously. I wonder why? Was he so stupid to think that he could whitewash taking his clothes off and having sex on film. And according to the film it's not just porn flicks he indulges in  it's living in a house with other stars where people can hook into their bedroom  the bathroom and where ever via webcams . It's 500 dollars an hour to entertain at a private party. Strip gigs at clothing optional hotels. Doing something called meth which I presume is a drug. And then you have the balls to get angry when someone at a club gig tries to touch you ---- because he's legit now. Oy!  The only interesting  non-cardboard character is the Academy Award winning gay screen writer who wouldn't give his name. And considering this is a documentary  well  porn is as porn does. You can tell he's most amused by the dumb-bunny porn star.  Glen has one hyper-nellie manager (Kyle) who wants to sell' him as a porno-participant in hopes of getting him gay-club gigs. He tries to do the Svengalli-routine. Wear this Don't smile say this in what amounts to controlling issues. But our anti-hero will not be controlled or told what to do. That's the first mistake. I'm not saying Kyle was right but if any budding singer starts questioning the manager  they're not going to get far. Kind of like: He who is his own lawyer has a fool for a client.  All of this wouldn't have been bad if it weren't for one small tiny bit of information. Drum roll  please. He's bad. He sucks. His singing talent ranks up there with Ashlee Simpson. It's hard to root for someone who -- while trying make his dream come true --- at 50! --- doesn't work like normal people. No job. Can you say lazy-ass? And the whining  and the Why don't they accept me. song and dance. And after a few months of scraping the surface of the music industry  he spouts off  Why don't I have a record deal by now. What? Actors are waiters. Writers work in low-level newspapers or mags -- whatever. This guy is above that. It's true. He wants his success now merely because he decided he wanted it. Whine. Whine Whine. His lover leaves him to return to nursing but I tell ya I wouldn't want that moron dispensing medical care to me. Both of them were useless. Airheads. The movie is useless. Unless you really like Whine and Cheeesy people stay away. Do not waste your money on the crappy lives of useless people  there are far more interesting things stuck to the bottom of your shoe.\n",

One is a small segment about 10 seconds long where they interview the factory managers where the fish is processed and he briefly mentions how 50 years ago the Nile Perch was introduced into the lake and it consumed the other fish species. The film maker makes no attempt to follow up on the matter or go deeper into it. The second attempt is when within this documentary they film the showing of another documentary that is discussing the environmental impact the Nile Perch has introduced  and again no real attempt is made to expand on just how devastating the problem has become.   The subject matter that this documentary does delve into has nothing to do with the Perch fish itself and more to do with the problems facing most African countries. The film tries to link the introduction of the Perch fish with AIDS  Poverty and Pollution in Tanzania but never makes a direct connection. As any intelligent person well read with problems in Africa  the problems shown here are not unique to Tanzania but affect most of Africa and have nothing to do with the fish. It would have been great if the film makers would have shown how the local economy or life was before the fish was introduced and how it has been negatively impacted by the introduction of the fish but they don't. The fact of the matter is that many of the people they interview say that the fish has provided jobs and opportunity for many. Yes things are BAD within the town of Mwanza but they are far worst in other parts of the country and continent for that matter.  A weak attempt by the documentary makers to link the fish to famine problems in Tanzania is quickly discredited by the documentary itself. First off Tanzania is a very large country and Lake Victoria is only a small portion of the country. Many of the individuals interview actually say that they can to Mwanza  the fishing town on the lake  to find a job and feed their families because things were so bad in other parts of the country.   This documentary is very weak  has no narrative and makes no attempt to actually link anything they display to the Nile Perch. It plays on people's emotions by displaying images of the devastation of poverty  famine and AIDS making no attempt to show you how any of this is unique to the Lake Victoria region of Tanzania or directly related to the Perch Fish. The fact is most of the problems have more to do with War  Globalization and Christianity than and environmental effect of the Perch fish itself.\n",

      "When a BBC murder thriller is this rife with heterosexual dysfunction  you know who the killer must be: The Homosexual.  Who murdered the sexy blonde teenager (who's also a pathological liar) on her way home from school? Let's see  could it be the mother who (against all common sense) is letting her teenaged son make unchaperoned visits to his serial-killer father behind bars? Could it be the moody son  who's impressed by his dad's no-nonsense attitude about women? Could it be the serial killer himself  who seems able to manipulate events from behind bars  a la Hannibal Lecter? Could it be mom's boyfriend  a teacher at the school whose affair with an ex-student led to his wife's suicide? Or could it be boyfriend's daughter  who goes blabbing everyone's secrets at school  causing untold misery? No  it's none of these likely suspects. It's...The Homosexual!  The only mystery for the viewer is guessing who The Homosexual is. Of course  it could be anybody  since the only characteristics of The Homosexual are shameful secrecy and a propensity to murder and otherwise make life complicated for the normal folks. The Homosexual is the invisible root cause of society's ills; only when this person is exposed and eliminated can the fractured family come back together  and things can return to normal...whatever that is.  As for the cast  both Jemma Redgrave and Robson Green are now officially past their sell-by dates. The world could get by marvelously without ever seeing either on screen again  but as long as the BBC has roles for The Aggrieved Woman and The Misunderstood Man  I suppose they'll keep coming back in movies like this one.\n",

      "Debbie Boone had a monster hit with her recording of the pop song You Light Up My Life; the Didi Conn film of the same name  however  was a horrifically embarrassing flop. Conn plays the stereotypically goofy-homely-vulnerable girl who is in love with Michael Zaslow  who plays the stereotypical yuppie-wannabe guy. They are engaged  but every one knows that Zaslow isn't going to marry any one that isn't blonde and built  so only Didi is surprised when he dumps her. Needless to say  Didi is quite embarrassed.  Fortunately  she has been doing a little songwriting in her spare time  and she's come up with a tune she thinks is pretty nifty. She calls it--can you guess?--You Light Up My Life. She hops in the car and drives off to the big city to sell her song and make a new life. Now  I recall sitting in the theatre and watching her hop in the car to drive off to the big city  and thinking Well thank heavens  we've finally got all the exposition out of the way. Now maybe something interesting will happen. And something interesting did happen. The credits rolled.  Yep  that was it. Not only was the movie badly acted  badly written  and badly filmed  it also ended in the middle. This movie is a really  profoundly bad movie  and we're not talking cult-movie-bad here. We're talking unmitigated flop  a real yawner from start to finish. If you liked the Debbie Boone song by all means buy a copy of it. But don't waste your time or money on this flick. This is one movie you'll be glad you missed.  Gary F. Taylor  aka GFT  Amazon Reviewer\n",

      "Normally i would applaud a movie that tries to do something different or original in a genre. It is obvious that this movie is some sort of parody on ninja movies. And i really did my best to enjoy the movie. But I just couldn't. The jokes aren't funny enough! (I've seen my share of Japanese movies. And most of the times I like and understand the humor used in those movies. Red Shadow is just silly!)The characters that are portrayed in this movie know that this isn't a serious movie and show that all is about the fun. Look at the characters from parodies like Hot Shots or Scary Movie. Everything they do on the screen is done with a straight face and never fall out of character! And because of this  certain scenes become funny and hilarious. In Red Shadow the actors never achieve that. The shadow ninja's supposed to be very skilled and deadly. Sadly the actors don't do their best in convincing us of their talents. They don't do things with a straight face. The jokes would have worked better if they did! The bad choreography of the action scenes also damaged the viewing experience for me. I like humor in martial arts movies as long as the action is good. Red Shadow just fails in that department. So what is left to be enjoyed. Well the music (techno) was uplifting. It had to be as the action it self never is exciting. And there are some short dramatic scenes that are good but simple. The use of humor lack of story and depth make me think that this movie is meant for children. But I do wonder if children actually would like this movie. Waste of time!\n",

      "One Night at McCool's wants you to think it is a hip and clever black comedy. It pushes its quirky characters and outrageous situations at the viewer like a crack dealer making overtime. The premise is about a gold digging woman  named Jewel who dates men to get them to steal and sometimes murder  so she can have all the worldly possesions she so desperately desires. You know  this wouldn't be a bad strategy  if she chased after rich guys. This film really wants one to believe that a foxy con artist would waste time dating bartenders and Andrew Dice Clay. Please. That major flaw in Jewel's scheme is really the only entertainment to found found in this stinker (and that's unintentional). Watching it  it is not hard to believe there could have been a good movie inside it somewhere. One Night at McCool's just could not decide what direction it wanted to take  so just sat in the middle of the road like a dead armadillo. It tries to be sexy but no clothes are removed on camera  and the few scenes of body head are dreadfully pedestrian. There is one recurring scene where a hitman is asking the protaganist (played by Matt Dillon) about how the sex is with Jewel. It seems like Matt doesn't know  neither do the viewers. Why was he dating her anyway? One Night at Mccool's also wants to be funny. Sorry  bizarre coincidences and misunderstandings didn't even work on Three's Company. What's worse is that this movie really seemed like it was going for a dark atmosphere to accompany its comedy. Kind of like a sophomoric Coen brothers film but its shallow script could not play subtlety  nor could its lackluster dirction sledgehammer in any shocks. What the audience is left with is a film that seems to busy trying to please everybody and just losing any appeal along the way.\n",

That is what I would have to say if I liked the show  though I'm sure you can see the obvious sarcasm. I've noticed some people have been comparing this show to 12 oz. Mouse and Squid Billies.

      "Remember when Rick Mercer was funny? 22 Minutes was a great show when Rick Mercer was on it and Made In Canada was a great show once too. Talking To Americans was such a funny special too. But like my friend said Rick Mercer woke up one day and wasn't funny any more I think that day was when Rick Mercer Report went on the air. What is the point of this show? Rick Mercer reads wacky fake headlines  shows pictures of bad sheds that people mail in and then spends about 20 minutes of the 30 minute show going somewhere and just talking to people hoping to say something witty or clever enough to get on TV and maybe even make somebody somewhere laugh. We're supposed to be interested in seeing Rick Mercer visit a gymnastics team and then try to do some of their moves  and then suck at it on purpose while trying desperately to be funny. Rick Mercer got old or just lost interest or just ain't funny any more. Even his classic rant bits have lost all their bite and humor. You can say that about CBC comedy in general though because how many years have they been sticking Air Farce on TV to deliver the same kinds of useless jokes?\n",

      "I am deeply disturbed by some posts I am reading on the message boards for this movie  people saying it is actually a good movie! Just because this movie is Uwe Boll's best to date does not make it a good movie at all  no way in hell! Far Cry is a clichéd mess full of bad acting  poor direction  and an uninspired story with a shoddy script. This is Boll's first pure action movie  and news flash people  action movies aren't too hard to make because for a basic action flick all you need is explosions and gun battles scattered around a flimsy plot  and hey  Mr. Boll succeeds in doing that. House of the Dead  Alone in the Dark  and Bloodrayne  all horror games adapted into movies by Boll are far worse than this (they have no redeeming qualities). Far Cry boasts two things which make it his best yet: two good leads and a couple of well-done action sequences. Til Schweiger is quite good as Jack Carver  and Emmanuelle Vaugier is a strong female lead. The usually great Udo Kier is passable as the clichéd villain and the supporting cast are pretty damn bad. Towards the end of the film there is a surprisingly tense chase sequence which came as a shock considering Boll was behind the camera.  Unfortunately the rest of the movie has an incredibly cheap feel to it  with bad CGI  lame one-liners and clichés around every corner. Oh  and the worst lead up to a sex scene I think I have ever scene. Not only have the two only known each other for six hours  but all it takes is for him to say he kept warm while in the army by spooning his fellow soldiers. He already got her to take his clothes off by merely telling her to. Then he took his off and climbed into bed because he was afraid of hypothermia.  Anyway  to summarise  this is a bad movie. It is mindless action movie that can kill 80 minutes if you are totally bored. One could probably do worse than popping this in and watching it  but I'd personally say watch a classic action film like Die Hard or Predator and stay away from this derivative mess.  1½/5\n",

      "The most impressive thing about 'Anemic Cinema' is its title: an anagram which is very nearly also a palindrome. Unfortunately  it only works in American English  since in Britain 'anaemic' is spelt differently.  I've always found the dilettante Man Ray and his artistic efforts to be deeply pretentious  and I've never understood why his work attracts so much attention. Apart from his Rayographs (which he invented by accident  and which are merely direct-contact photo prints)  his one real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to depict female nudity in a manner that was accepted as art rather than as porn. But surely this had to happen eventually  and there's no real reason why Ray deserves the credit. The critical reaction to Man Ray reminds me of the story about the Emperor's New Clothes.  Back in the early 1960s  the second season of 'The Twilight Zone' opened each episode with a shot of revolving concentric circles in black and white. There's an image in 'Anemic Cinema' which is so similar  I wonder if 'Twilight Zone' borrowed it from this film. The main difference is that the revolving image here is a black and white spiral. Indeed  if ever there was any movie that deserves to be described as a spiral  this one is it. Throughout 'Anemic Cinema'  we're treated(?) to shots of a revolving disc containing words (in French) moving in a spiral. The effect is vertiginous  and the texts -- about incest and Eskimos -- are nearly Dada in their meaninglessness. I did laugh at one clever sexual pun.  The emperor is naked  folks  and this movie just barely rates 2 points out of 10. Au suivant!\n",

      "With so many good movies coming out in 1995 (particularly Mortal Kombat and Seven)  unfortunately  there had to be some bombs as well  and this film indeed falls into the latter category with a boring  predictable plot and a lousy ending. It seems that Antonio Banderas hasn't been able to find a decent script since Desperado  the only remarkable film he's done. Anyone with an eighth of a brain could tell who DeMornay's stalker was from the beginning. Her flashbacks of the death of her mother did nothing but muddle an already paper-thin story. Pity that Dennis Miller was wasted in this film; this part resembles his eerily similar role in The Net.   The convoluted ending had me shaking my head  as I pretty much did throughout the entire movie. Plus  any film that depicts animal cruelty in any shape or form  no matter how fake it looks  automatically gets the thumbs-down from me.   To make a long story short  if you want to enjoy a good thriller  then avoid this at all costs. Never talk to strangers...especially those who recommend this movie. 2/10\n",

      "After slightly over 50 years of avid film watching  I've come up with some simple rules for making good movies.  1.\tIntroduce your main characters early  certainly within the first half hour 2.\tKeep your characters to a minimum. If adapting a novel  combine characteristics and actions of minor characters   into one person 3.\tMake sure your characters actions have credibility; if necessary  create additional scenes to establish motivation 4.\tKeep the action clear. Violence does not have to be explicit  but it must not be confusing  either 5.\tGet the best music money can buy. Frequently it matters more than acting  photography  etc. 6.\tUsually if a movie isn't very good within the first 10 minutes  it's not going to get any better  `Cannon for Cordoba' is a textbook example of what happens when these simple rules are not followed. Elmer Bernstein's score is rinkydink  one of the worst I've ever heard in a modestly budgeted movie. This is altogether surprising considering Bernstein's credentials (`Man With the Golden Arm ' `The Magnificent Seven ' `The Great Escape ' `Sons of Katie Elder'). Paul Wendkos' direction is lackluster and confusing. Performances vary from very good (Don Gordon  Peter Duel) to terrible (Raf Vallone  Giovanna Ralli  Gabriele Tinti) with the usually reliable George Peppard falling somewhere in the middle. This should not be surprising  considering the mediocre direction and amateurish script  which breaks rules 1  2 and 3.  Don't waste your time. I give `Cannon for Cordoba' a `3'.\n",

It's such a great way to sit back  relax and escape the politics and world problems for a few hours. But this was not to be the case with this version of The Magnificent Seven.

      "THE RIDDLE was written and directed by Brendan Foley in what appears to be an attempt to pull the mysteries of the Charles Dickens' novels into a contemporary story  but that attempt is thwarted by electing to use the two periods of time format in which the 'riddle' is unraveled. Despite a cast of well-known actors  trying their best to pull off this direct to DVD movie  the end product is a long  tedious  amateurish mess that can only be considered as entertainment if viewers are fans of the cast as remembered from other films.   Mike Sullivan (Vinnie Jones) is a journalist confined to reporting on dog racing events while he dreams of important reporting assignments. A series of similar murders happens to include an old friend of Mike's - Sadie (Vera Day) who runs a pub on the banks of the Thames  having just discovered an old valuable unpublished manuscript by Charles Dickens  and has a heart of gold  giving sandwiches away to such pathetic creatures as an old tramp beachcomber (Derek Jacobi). Sadie's murder attracts Mike to the role of detective journalism and with the help of policewoman Kate (Julie Cox) he begins to tie the investigation to clues he finds in reading the Dickens manuscript. Disrupting the flow of this rather simplistic story is the use of flashbacks to Dickens' time as Dickens (again Derek Jacobi) narrates a rather personal story of peculiar murders. The parallel between stories and the cross casting among actors may have worked in another's hands  but the finessing of this kind of venture escapes writer/director Brendan Foley. He draws his story to a close (at long last) with a tired Hollywoodesque ending.   In addition to Jones  Jacobi  Cox  and Day  the film somehow attracted the attention of Vanessa Redgrave  Jason Flemyng  PH Moriarty and Mel Smith: their contributions are minimal but happily distracting. This is a flimsy bit of treacle leaving the viewer wondering how films of this quality ever find funding. Grady Harp\n",

      "The Foreigner is a straight-to-video Steven Seagal film that was originally intended to be released as a theatrical feature in March  2003  an intention which was reportedly reversed when Seagal's prior film (Half Past Dead) tanked at the box office. According to some reports  the film had a lavish $20 million budget  including location shoots in Warsaw and Paris  and was completed as part of the studio's obligation to a two-picture deal which was negotiated after the relative success of Exit Wounds seemed to indicate that Seagal still had a solid following.  Despite the size of their investment  Sony Screen Gems probably made the right move in shelving this movie. It is nearly incomprehensible. What am I saying? It IS incomprehensible. I don't think I understood what was going on at all  except in the very broadest terms.  Seagal is employed by a mysterious guy to deliver a mysterious package to another mysterious guy. Other mysterious guys try to stop him. Other highly mysterious guys try to kill the moderately mysterious guys who try to stop him. Other really  really mysterious guys do especially mysterious stuff  all of which which was in fact too mysterious for me to figure out. The intended recipient's mysterious wife tries to intercept the package before it can be delivered to her husband. Because he is a self-proclaimed consummate professional who has been hired to deliver the package only into the hands of the husband  Seagal at first defies the wife  then later gets involved in protecting her and her daughter from other mysterious guys with unexplained agendas  as well as from her husband.  Many people have mysterious  cryptic conversations. Many people blow each other's brains out. Some guys seem to die more than once  while in other scenes gunfights end without a clear view of the result  so the audience sees somebody die  but is not sure which one of the gunslingers is headed to boot hill. Allegiances shift often  adding further mystery. Or should I say confusion?  I don't know who was on whose side  or what anybody really wanted  and the resolution was as unsatisfying as the exposition. At the end of the movie  I just sat there thinking  That's the end? What the ...?  I couldn't even figure out the credits. IMDb says that Aussie actress Kate Fischer (from Sirens) was in this film  but I'll be damned if I know where. Either she was left on the cutting room floor or she wisely opted out of the project. She could have found some activities more beneficial to her career  like having unnecessary surgery  ripping those pesky insert cards out of magazines  or taking some community college courses in animal husbandry.  Seagal used to be a pretty fair hand-to-hand combatant  but the action scenes didn't manage to redeem this film at all. Seagal is in his 50's now and is a very large man  so he is reduced to a mimimal level of physical exertion and even during that he is contained in a knee-length coat to hide his inchoate Brandoesque girth. He might even get a little winded removing the wrappers from candy bars  although that's understandable if you estimate just how many of those he must have to eat to maintain his present girth.  Steven Seagal seemed to be making a comeback with Exit Wounds  but if his last film was half past dead  this one must be pretty close to filling out the other half.\n",

      "Without a doubt this is the WORSE comicbook movie every made. PERIOD!! Yes  it's worse then Dolph Lundgren's (1989) Punisher. Yup.. worse then the 1979 & 1991 Captain America movies. Oh yeah  it's even WORSE then Christopher Reed scripted Superman IV: Quest for Peace movie. Sheeshh.. that movie was so bad that the guy who played Nuclear Man only starred in one other film and it was only on T.V. =oP  This movie is D quality. I had a chance to watch it on the SciFi channel back in 1997. I had heard it was pretty bad  but had nothing else to do that night so I figured I check it out. What a waste of an hour and a half. I would have been better off watching reruns of Different Strokes. Besides having the lamest special effects and worse acting I've ever seen  the whole script was just awful and not well directed at all. Thankfully a NEW Fantastic Four movie is being done and hopefully this version will do the heroes justice. I was hoping for a New SPAWN movie in the future  but it has yet to materialize.   Do not rent this movie. If you happen to see it being televised on cable  check it out. Be warned though  you'll most like be flipping the channel after the first 15 mins.\n",

      "In & Out made me want to vomit. I have never seen such a shameless film! It seriously wanted to say that being gay is something wonderful and joyous  but has no idea how to say it. To me this was not a comedy  unless cruel sick jokes are something to laugh at when a victim falls for it.   From what I saw  this film had four (4) major flaws starting with (A) Matt Dillion's character as he announces to the world that is former teacher  Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) is gay. Never mind how unbelievable it is that Matt Dillion character won an Oscar for what looked like a serious role on the edge of a crack-up. But why would he say such a thing? After all  this was never an issue with Howard's students  his friends  family  nor his finace. Nobody. So why would he say something like it when it wasn't true? More to the point  why doesn't the movie supply us with an answer as to why he said it? The reason is because there is NO answer  and for the convenience of the plot none is provided. The second (B) flaw is with the fact the film seems to have forgotten what homosexuality is--the attraction and sexual relation to members of the same sex. In this movie  being gay is based on liking Barbara Streisand musicals and being passionate about literature. It's all based on stereotypes!  Both of these flaws are met up again at that must-be-seen-to-be-believed graduation ceremony. Matt Dillion finds out about the commotion going on in that small town and the film looks poised to let us know what made him say such a thing. When he arrives to the ceremony  he says nothing  and I wondered why in the world he then came there at all. He didn't solve anything. Then when all of the audience stood to announce they were gay  I was so moved I wanted to throw up! Those folks were standing up in defense of Howard being gay by mocking all of those stereotypes. What the film forgot is that it was using those stereotypes to show why Howard was gay. They filmmakers just shot themselves in the foot! But wait there's more!  During the ceremony (C) Howard appeared to be on trial to lose is job as a teacher  because people believed that he would influence his students to be gay. What the film was trying to say is that homosexuals NEVER recruit  and that he wouldn't influence his students. But did we not see Tom Selleck's character endlessly pressure Howard over and over again  even to the point of kissing him unexpectedly  to come out of the closet when  in my mind  there was no closet to come out of? From that  the film clearly show that homosexual are capable of recruiting. The film  again  then shoots itself in the foot.  And (D) when Howard came out of the closet  did anyone not notice how the screenplay shut him up for the rest of the film? I counted only three lines he had afterwards: Yup! to his parents  Hi there! to a student  and Are you ready? to Tom Selleck before the last vomitous scene. I might be low by one  but the point is he is not allowed to tell us what made him decide he was gay. I wanted to know what was in his head  because I never for once believed he was gay.  As bonuses  the movie also includes several truly offensive scenes. One in which Howard is asking a priest in confession for advice about what to do for a friend (him)  who is engaged and has not yet had sex with his fiance. Does that make him gay? he asks. The priest responsed Oh yes  he's definitely gay. Uh-huh. Or what about the scene when all the old ladies are gathered around telling Howard's mother that she doesn't need to be sad about her son's deep  dark secret because  well...everyone has them. Then one the ladies confessed that she's never seen The Bridges of Madison County. Funny? No! Becuase the film shows that it is insensitive and has no idea how devestating it can be to family to have one of its members announced that he/she is gay. I know. I have several friends that are gay  and none of their families took it well at all. That was a poor way to diffuse the whole situation.  The last straw for me was the last scene that gave they appearence that Tom and Kevin were getting married. The camera panned down very slowly to the front of the church when... It wasn't what you thought! I had been thoroughly disgusted by that point  and I never could forgive that sick joke. I have nothing against films about being gay or homosexuality. Philadelphia and Longtime Companion were very honest and true in what they had to say. In & Out is just screaming for political correctness  but has no idea of the corruption at its core. what I gathered from the film is that if you are 99% straight and 1% gay  meaning if you have the slightless doubt  YOU ARE DEFINITELY GAY. It's like gayness is becoming a dominant trait in genetics. In reality if everyone told you over and over that you were worthless and stupid  you would eventually believe it too  wouldn't you? This is what happened to Howard Brackett about being gay. I left the theater sad and angry. Angry the whole weekend  in fact. This was a seriously sick and cruel film  the WORST of 1997.\n",

      "(This review does not necessarily expose the plot of the movie  however it may change one's expectations of the movie and thus make for a less enjoyable experience.)   Ever rented a scary movie  expecting to be on the edge of your seat in fear  and instead ended up howling in laughter at each and every stupid turn of the plot? This movie had so many opportunities to impress and actually scare the viewer. It was cut poorly and jumped around too much; making references to the past seem more like excuses as to why the plot was heading in its particular direction. The writers must not have thought about how the potentially excellent plot should have been carried out  because the poor construction of time throughout the plot is discouraging to the viewer and makes the movie increasingly tiring to watch.  Almost worse than the writers having abused what could have been an excellent and classic thriller was the fact that it gradually relied on cheap tactics for a scare. The acting didn't make it scary  and the situations hardly made it scary  therefore it needed a few dark scenes with things jumping out at you to make it worthwhile. Even those were predictable.  Not even the gore could've saved the plot  and it rivals the gore of the successful thriller Se7en.  Speaking of Se7en  I feel like Saw tried to follow Se7en's incredibly fascinating psychological theme  but failed miserably in doing so. I was terribly disappointed in the lack of analysis and plot structure surrounding the psychology of the killer. The beginning scenes tease the viewer into thinking that this is a psychological thriller; believe me  it is far from that.  Oh  did I mention poor acting? At first  Cary Elwes seems makes a convincing performance; however  this completely deteriorates at the most crucial parts of the plot. I was left in tears of laughter at this performance  which is worthy of a Razzie. The performance of Leigh Whannell is also terrible and too played-out  although not as bad as the performance by Elwes  and the big red flag with this is that Whannell is also a writer for the movie.  The end of Saw could never make up for having lost the entire middle of it  and that is what makes it a huge failure. It was an opportunity wasted  and I have no clue as to why Monica Potter and Danny Glover chose to take roles in this movie.  I am mad at myself for wasting money on just renting it. It was definitely not worth the $4  and in the future I will definitely avoid seeing anything having to do with Elwes  Whannell or James Wan. The big tragedy in this is not that it lacked basis to its plot  it's that the great potential storyline was thrown away and poor acting added insult to injury. I'll avoid the poor puns involving the title and just conclude with this: don't watch this movie.\n",

      "THE DEADLY MANTIS certainly won't scare any one  but as sci-fi programmers go it is better than most. A volcanic eruption at the south pole thaws out a giant  prehistoric preying mantis at the north pole. Military men go missing. Dr. Ned (William Hopper--Hedda Hopper's son and best known as Paul Drake on television's PERRY MASON) is called in to i.d. the creature--but by this time the creature has eaten up several Eskimo and is en route to the Washington Monument.  About a third or more of the film consists of stock footage: old government educational films  military men in radar rooms  air planes--and would you believe Eskimos putting out to sea? Which explains  of course  why a tribe of Eskimo is attacked in the movie. (Hey  Guys! Think we can work this in?) Mix in some negligible special effects  some clunky dialogue  and some sexist attitudes and you're good to go.

      "I know we shouldn't expect much from a low-budget indie film. But the idea behind it is sound: an attempt to open America's eyes to the cozy relationship between the government  and the journalists that are supposed to be keeping an eye out against it. But somehow the documentary aspect of it  takes away from its drama. The protests during the 2004 Republican convention in New York were not that compelling to make a documentary about it. Those kinds of compelling protests belong to the era of the 1960's.  It would have been better to stick to a drama format. Perhaps a slow build-up where the young journalist's eyes are gradually opened up to the conspiracy.\n",

      "Lame is really the best way to describe this movie. It has a real poor script  uninteresting dialog and characters and it's lacking in basically everything else as well.   There are too many characters and problem is that you don't care about any of them. What the movie is lacking is one good and clear main character. Instead now the movie has a bit of everything  it has a bit of an hero  it has a bit of a love interest and it has a bit of villain. I wish it only had a bit less Ghoulies though  fore they are just mostly very annoying in this movie.  Ghoulies are supposed to be devilish creatures  who murder for pleasure. In this movie however all they want to do is drink beer and watch naked college girls. Besides  someone had the 'brilliant' idea to let the Ghoulies be able to talk this time. This works out really poorly and annoying. The Ghoulie-puppets had been definitely upgraded for this movie and they are more detailed looking and are able to do more  however at the same time they are way more fake looking than the ones from the previous Ghoulies movies.  It's obvious that the aim for this movie was more comedy than horror this time. The movie is like a lame '80's high-school comedy (even though this movie got released in 1991). It's humor is really the worst and most lame thing about the entire movie. It's so incredibly annoying and simply not funny at all.  The story is not going anywhere with its story and the movie is just basically one big mess  that never seems to end. The Ghoulies plot line seems basically to have nothing to do at all with the other plot lines of the movie  involving the human characters. The movie is not at all about the Ghoulies terrorizing a college  with the humans trying to hunt them down and stop their rampage. No big surprise that this is Brent Olson's only written movie as of yet. He simply has no talent for it and I think that he has discovered this as well and has gone back to college himself instead.  Even when compared to the previous Ghoulies movies; this movie is just simply terrible!  2/10\n",

      "I saw this film 2 weeks prior to going on a snowboarding holiday  so for me it was really just to get my mind in mode for my holiday. The film boasts some sweet snowboarding skills  throughout the films in the action scenes. These moments were great  a bit like watching extreme sports channel. Sadly the story was quite honestly awful  the acting was generally alright  with a fairly small cast. This film is apparently comedy  at least it tries to be comical  but it seems like the comedy and the storyline was written by a teenager. The story lacks any depth or purpose and the comedy struggles to be anything more than a small snigger a few times during the movie. It might be worth renting just to see the snowboarding action  but then again there are plenty of movies out there that are totally devoted to snowboarding stunts and don't feature a UN-funny badly written story.\n",

Like many Hong Kong films geared for the teen audience  the major fanbase of actors like the Twins (the two girls who stars in this film) and Ekin Cheng  there is so much bad music to prod the audience into believing certain scenes are funny  clever  etc.  The final conclusion: It's all for naught.

      "This is the first time I feel the need to comment on IMDb  to write some sort of a review and  as it so often happens  it's not because of a really excellent film  but a truly appalling one.  Take the narrating style the youngest might relate to the Max Payne video game series  a cast of virtually unkonwns (which is not a bad thing in itself)  poor dialogs  some dark scenes but not many enough  and make a film out of it. Don't worry about the bad acting  the length (way too long)  the lack of immersion (the lead character has to be one of the lest interesting I've seen in a long time - couldn't care less if he died) or the often ridiculous solutions they find to certain problems the lead character finds himself in.  I wouldn't have written anything if it hadn't been for another review here  giving it 10 stars. I gave it four  but maybe three is closer to what I feel about it. Not only do I not wish to see it again  but the mere thought of it takes me dangerously close to wanting to kill myself. Oh  and a so called noir film is nothing without a good soundtrack - not the case here. The ending song sounds like it was more suitable to a western movie.

The music was frickin' bad and the plot played out like a BYU bowl game  very predictable (avoiding embarrassment by scoring  a late game flurry of touchdowns  a rally that falls short and leads to a loss). In essence  the half-childish / half-naive Will (the movie's fetcher) and his religiously confused brother Danny (we'll just call him a democrat)  treat Kirby (the movie's Sweet Spirit)  the 3rd member of their hapless Mormon boy band  like crap until the man and father figure of the film (the stage manager  Jill) has a talk with Will and straightens him out. Believably  Will's personality changes 180 degrees and he's instantly the mature and self-aware leader of the band. This would be a cute  perhaps funny  10 minute roadshow gig  but the fact that the movie is 93 minutes long really sucks the life out of you if you watch it to the end. My advise  take the money you'd normally spend to rent this show and either burn it in your fireplace or flush it down the toilet  more entertainment with much less time commitment. If you want to watch a better movie of the same genre  get Saints and Soldiers  not a comedy but an infinitely better show (actually  Kirby has more funny stuff in Saints than he does in SOP).\n",

Despite its local provenance (and its relation to a hometown tragedy  namely the beating death of Eddie Polec in 1994)  I really have to come down hard on this movie. The director  for reasons best known to himself  decided to shoot the entire film guerilla-style  with nonstop handheld cameras and rapidfire cuts. Such technique might work for the scenes of jarring violence  but is utterly inappropriate for the rest of the material  which makes up the majority of the film. A stroll down the sidewalk  a brother-to-brother discussion on a sofa  hell  even a kiss on a first-date are all shot cusinart-style  distracting this viewer from ever being able to enter into the drama. Martin also undercuts his narrative by packing in far too many topics: besides the birth of mob violence  we get anorexia  alcoholism  divorce  racism  parental abuse...did I miss anything? No doubt a better cast (and a better-focused direction) would have knit these threads together  as Martin surely intended  to demonstrate how one moral flaw leads into and sustains a host of others...but good intentions do not necessarily a great film make.

The movie starts off portraying a couple exploring their sexual fantasies amidst their work environments or wherever and whatever suits their fancy. The couple takes an excursion to a retreat and bathhouse where they run into a woman that's willing to be a part of a three-some and fulfill some of their fantasies. At this point  we only know that this couple is well off but we don't know until they return that the fiancé is part of a well-to-do political family. The man hopes to be on the rise to the point of possibly getting a congressional seat after the marriage. They then receive a package in the mail from an anonymous source with explicit pictures of their encounter at the bath house and their qwest begins as to how and why they were filmed  who sent the package  what they want  and how to clear their names before any of this gets out. This qwest becomes an obsession that leads them deeper into seedier worlds and takes a lot of their time  to the point where their friends & family wonder what they're doing all day and why they look rundown all the time. This movie is interesting at times but drifts into ridiculousness as they personally seek out the problem instead of getting the police involved early on because of their pride. This mistake  of course  keeps the movie going. The performances are fine despite the no-name cast but the lunacy of the situation overrides and the movie starts to become ho-hum about ½ the way through. And of course  they throw in a twist at the end that defies and challenges everything that happened prior(as is the norm these days when they don't know what else to do to spice up the movie). This doesn't help this movie one bit  though.\n",

      "I'm not sure what the appeal of this movie is  but I couldn't find it. It's a really long  barely credible  hardly lucid conversation between three guys on one set.   It doesn't move anywhere  the characters are just totally bizarre  the underlying plot equally so. It's lost on me  definitely a walk out movie.  The one thing that keeps you from walking out is the ever unrealized possibility that it might have some kind of point or meaningful climax  and the fact that  all irritation aside at the banal personalities  they're acted quite reasonably. But you have to brace yourself for endless dialog  wishing on many an occasion that Teach would just shut the %*&* up for a moment.\n",

      "As an avid Disney fan  I was not totally impressed by this movie  certainly not motivated enough to catch it in the theaters. I am  however  so glad that I caught it on DVD and watched the special features.  You MUST check out the Moose commentary: the entire movie can be viewed with commentary from Rutt and Tuke  the comic relief moose of the story  who are voiced by Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas. Two veterans of the famous Second City comedy troupe ad-lib - in character - for an hour and a half about a movie that they are clearly fond of. I laughed the whole time. The enjoyment I got from this commentary completely made up for the tepid reaction I had to the film itself. Do yourself a favor and listen to it!\n",

      "I was in this movie as an extra in the Dallas filming in July 1975. Some of the things you see today and take for granted in movie making  were implemented in this movie. The movie premise  the costumes  the special effects  the acting. It all was ahead of its time. It opened the door for movies such as Star Wars  the Terminator  the Matrix  and X-Men movies. Now people look at it and they say  Well this does not add up to this new special effects story... It did not have any computer graphics and such as the new movies do these days. It did have a story  and a wonderful cast  and a hell of a director! The places it was filmed like the Dallas' World Trade Center  and the Zale Building and the Ft. Worth Water Gardens were at that time the most modern and futuristic backdrops in which to film. The director Michael Anderson was very creative and he tried to show a perfect future that was flawed by human desires and frailty's. It was my first film experience  the first of six films I have been in. Just because it was filmed in Texas does not make it any less a wonderful piece of filmmaker's art. Watch it again and appreciate it more. This movie was the foundation that set the standard for many great films that we now enjoy. Well  my hand is blinking... I got to run. Santuary awaits...\n",

      "This appears to be two movies spliced into one. In the first  ZaSu Pitts is a renegade in a small town. She wants to help the romantic life of Marjorie Woodworth. OK: I'd never heard of her before either. But she and Pitts are in both parts of this concoction.  Before we know it  Pitts is no longer Miss {Polly. She is Emmie. I had to rewind to see if I'd fallen asleep somewhere. I hadn't. She no longer in a small town but on her way to the title Honeymoon destination.  The movie has some cute moments. The first part is better  with roles for what seems to be every third-rate character actress working in Hollywood at the time.  And what of Ms. Woolworth? She sounds a little like Betty Hutton. She sounds a little like Marie Wilson. She's pretty  certainly. But she's no comedienne.  Pitts often was used in very small roles. Here she has the largest role. She's always fun  though this movie made me wonder if a little of her doesn't go quite a long way. (As a comic. When she was a tragic actress in Von Stroheim silents -- The Wedding March and Greed are the two I have seen -- she was brilliant.)\n",

      "This movie is the very worst that I have ever seen. You might think that you have seen some bad movies in your time  but if you haven't seen this one you don't know how terrible a movie can be. But wait  there's worse news! The studio will soon rerelease this masterpiece (I'm being ironic) for all to see! The only things worse than the plot of this movie are the effects  the acting  the direction  and the production. Bill Rebane  the poor man's Ed Wood (not that there is a rich man's Ed Wood) (I like Ed Wood's movies  though) manages to keep things moving at a snail's pace throughout this film. It opens with the capture of a baby bigfoot (a Littlefoot? --sorry  couldn't help it) by a pair of unlikable hunters  who are killed by the parent. This causes the entire town where the hunters lived to go on a Bigfoot hunting jihad. This is pretty much it for the plot. Nothing even remotely interesting happens  and we the viewers are never able to care about any of the characters. If one is interested in the films of Rebane I would recommend almost any other over this. However  as I said  it will soon be rereleased by Troma in order to bore a new generation of filmgoers.\n",

      "If one wants to have a character in a movie have a disturbing sexual encounter that would shame that character in later life the only thing left that an audience would see as shameful was bestiality and now it has been done. Judging by some of the other comments even that did not succeed that well. I cannot remember one funny scene though I have to admit  I had to turn it off before it was finished. I did watch a part of the director's commentary and it appears he was as surprised as anyone that the movie was doing well. If you want to get the same feeling you get from this movie but only cheaper  stick your head in a pile of manure and breath deeply.\n",

      "Sure  this flick set in Eastern Europe is filled with sexy  but it absolutely has nothing to do with the Nicholas Cage flick 8mm An ambassador's daughter and her fiancée mix it up with a local woman in a threesome that ends up being taped. The tape is used for blackmail and the stakes get higher and higher as the couple try to work it out themselves instead of going to authorities.  The sex comes and goes -- and would be the only reason for renting it  I suppose if you like this sorta thing -- and is quite gratuitous towards the middle when we cruise along the porn scene looking for the other woman. I definitely question how it got into Blockbuster even with a Youth Restricted Sticker considering how just a hint over the edge of soft core it is. (Oh that's right  it's the double standard. Actual art-house flicks like The Dreamers and Y Tu Mama Tambien get castrated R versions  but Straight To DVD crap like this get the UNRATED banner proudly attached. Whatever.)   The acting is horrible  the plot is mind numbingly unoriginal  but really the worst offense is the idea that this is a sequel to 8mm. I'd give the flick a D for a grade and be nice  but considering they tried to trick me  it gets the F it frankly deserves.\n",

      "Let's not kid ourselves  this atrocity is not Plan Nine or Cat Women. It is bad  period! The performances vary from drama school theatrics (Marla English) to a 'couldn't care less' walk through (Tom Conway). The photography (even in a good print) is so murky it is occasionally hard to see what is happening. The real problem  however  is the aimless  pointless  nearly plot less story and the leaden  paceless direction. At a brisk 77 minutes it still feels endless.  The screenplay is especially inept. There are two story lines that only intersect at the very end of the picture. Tom Conway is trying to create a super race  using voodoo and modern science (although there is little science in evidence) which he can control telepathically. He is keeping his wife prisoner (for no discernible reason). Meanwhile a couple of petty crooks and a white hunter type guide are trying to find the village in which he is working  in the expectation of gold and jewels. When they finally arrive  Tom Conway decides that one of them  the woman  is the perfect subject for his experiments. She is turned into a monster  kills Conway (natch!) and then reverts to normal. She sees a gold statue half drowned in a boiling pool  tries to retrieve it and falls in the water and apparently drowns. The white hunter rescues the wife. In the final shot we see the supposedly drowned woman emerge as the monster again; threatening a sequel (now that really is a scary thought!).  The AIP producer  Samuel Z Arkoff  in a lecture included on the DVD  prides himself on spotting the teenage niche market and satisfying it with ingenious low budget movies. However  it is difficult to see how anyone could think this rancid concoction would satisfy any sort of audience. What appeal do they think it could possibly have? The monster appears so rarely that it could hardly be called a horror film. The jungle action is tepid and tedious. There are no teenagers in it and no characters that teenagers could be expected to identify with.  The producers exposed 77 minutes of film  but they didn't make a movie. This is a con trick and Arkoff should be ashamed of his association with it.\n",

      "Beethovan Lives Upstairs is a very bad movie. In my World History class  our teacher had us watch this movie and Amadeus to be able to compare the two composers or something. We watched Amadeus first and it was a very good movie  but when she had us watch this movie directly after that  I couldn't believe what I was seeing. The acting was horrific  the costumes were ugly (the little boy's was especially ugly and girlish)  and the cinematography was z-grade. My Friend compared it to a home movie without the date display in the bottom right corner. I understand this was a T.V. movie from Canada and probably cost $10 to make  but please  they could have done better. I have seen a few good T.V. movies in my time  but this was not one of them. The biggest thing that I don't understand is why my World History class couldn't just watch Immortal Beloved or something. How is it possible to compare composers when given the movie Amadeus  for Mozart  and Beethovan Lives Upstairs  for Beethovan? It's not possible to do that when this is the choice of movie for Beethovan. I give Amadeus an A- (9 out of 10) if anyone cares to know  but Beethovan Lives Upstairs gets an F (1 out of 10).\n",

      "I just recently watched Ed Wood Jr.'s autobiographical movie Glen or Glenda for the first time after having heard so much about it for so many years. Nothing I had read or heard about this film could prepare me for what I saw. This has to be the most bizarre movie ever made. Stampeding buffalo  women in bondage  Satan prancing around and Bela Lugosi  rambling only as he can  Bevare  Bevare....pull the string  pull the string...  it was totally insane. The acting was atrocious and the dialog was unintentionally hilarious  exactly what one would expect from an Ed Wood film. Having said all that  as horrible as this movie was  I have to give Wood credit...he was way ahead of his time. You have to remember that when this movie was made transvestites were not even discussed in public  much less the subject for a movie. I have read that Wood was a transvestite in real life  and I'm sure this movie was based on his own experiences. It was sad to see Bela Lugosi having to say the ridiculous lines he had to say for this film  but it was kind of Ed Wood Jr. to at least give Mr. Lugosi an acting job at a time in Bela's life when he was penniless and a drug addict and no one else in Hollywood would hire him. If you have never seen this film then you have to see it  especially if you are a fan of Ed Wood Jr.\n",

      "Frankie Muniz plays Jason who is a high school student. His biggest problem is his life is built on small or big lies that puts him into trouble most times. However  he cannot escape from his teacher and he finishes his creative writing homework just before its deadline. While he is biking fast to hand his homework to the teacher  he crushes into a car. As he explains the situation to grumpy man(Giamatti) in the car  he gives him a lift to his school. But the problem is Jason leaves his homework in the car  the other way of saying this is Marty Wolf(Giamatti) steals it.  After a few months Jason goes to a movie and sees a trailer that takes him aback. Because the story of the movie is based on his homework. He tells that to his parents but of course they don't believe him. Especially his father uses words which insults him. Jason decides to go to LA and find Wolf to tell his father that Jason is not a liar. When Wolf refuses it  Jason takes action and ruins his life.  This is the short story of the Big Fat Liar. Well  as a kids movie it might be a light hearted one but there are some errors that even could would ask if that is possible. Such as  having such a small amount of money and going to LA with a friend to sort the problem out  having access to this cinema producer's highly protected house and office  setting up a telecommunications system overnight.Does it seem believable? It does not. Well this is a kids movie but kids are not that gullible.  Big Fat Liar offers some little pleasure to its target audience. Unfortunately  I am not a big fat liar to say that this is a good movie. ** out of *****\n",

      "I walked into Blockbuster  itchin' to watch some good old fashion action movies. So i browsed around the action section until this movie caught my attention because the cover had in big bold letter SANDRA BULLOCK. An action movie with Sandra Bullock in it and it's rated R!? YAY! Although I will admit i prefer her in a comedy but if this is anything like 'Speed' then i was sold. Sadly Sandra really is not in this movie  her role is minor: Panicky kidnapped girlfriend (She is in fifth place on the actors listing for Jeebus shakes!) Apparently this was her first movie role (and after watching this movie  i figured as much) Sandra is the only living human in this movie  everyone else might as well be a Zombie in a B-Horror Flick. This movie deceived me saying Sandra was the lead . . . i fell for it like Biff from 'Back to the Future' when Marty yells WHAT'S THAT . . .!!! God  i wish i watched that instead of this.  Sandra is the only bright side of this movie  every time she is on camera it is like she is picking up shock paddles and yelling CLEAR! to get this movies going but it flat lines no matter how hard she tries. More on Sandra later . . .   The Movie is dull. Very Dull. Think of the Dullest moment in your life then imagine living through that moment for 110 minutes (for me  it is this movie). This movie even somehow makes Gun Fights and Bullet time effects boring  so boring that Elephant Tranquilizers are put to shame. And this movie's idea of Bullet Time is a close up of an AK in slow motion which mocks you as the caps spitting out of it represent each second of your life as it slowly ticks away. And I knew i was watching a bad movie because i found myself fast forwarding THROUGH-THE-ACTION! The plot? . . . there was a plot? Music? . . . even by 80s muck standards is Bad but at least it's the one thing that kept me awake. Acting? Sandra Bullock was good and . . . ummm . . . moving on. Is it any good since it IS rated R? No  unless R stands for Ridicules-snooze-fest.  And it is really 80s Cliché when a movie opens with an overhead view of a city (rocking guitar licks or power ballet) and ends with a gun fight in a grim factory complete with steel walkways and assorted pipes. Both of which this movie satisfies. At least this movie establishes what era it's from which was unnecessary since Sandra's hair was screaming 1980s!!!! And a movie gets really ham fisted when you watch an assassin stripper kill a nerd in the bathroom and stuff his body in a box  which you respond to sadly saying: that is probably the most action that poor sap ever got. Another Hammy moment is at the beginning when some-Secret-Agent-Dude caps a crowd of people and apparently this movie thinks people jump into the air and fall to the ground when they die. All that scene needed was the Mario death ditty or maybe Contra sound effects but Nintendo might have sued.  And it is sad when the main action hero of this movie rips off other BETTER movie icons. Before the big gun scene  Da hero is found standing in a boxing ring ('Rocky' anyone?)  sporting a leather fedora (not 'Indiana Jones' too) with an ominous spotlights behind him (Terminator the 2nd before owning T-1000) What is really REALLY sad is that people on Youtube or Dailymotion can film better quality videos (with a crappy webcam no less) then this movie. I'm serious  most Rant videos recorded with bad audio and blurry picture are more entertaining then this movie. I cannot even call this movie by it's given name for it's very name bring back horrid memories of watching this cruel and unusual punishment (a freaking violation against human rights!) The only bright speck in this dark abysmal abyss is Sandra's career started taking off thanks to this movie. But oh Sandra . . . why did you have to be in such a nightmare? The paycheck better been worth it. The DVD also graces you with a little back story on Sandra as an extra  seen how she is the only one from this movie who end up being a house hold name. Which explains why this movie uses her name as bait for unsuspecting movie buffs  Crafty little critter.  I don't have much experience with bad films but i know BAD when i see it. I could bounce back from 'Mazes and Monsters' with a good old campy Bruce Willis Comedy. But not even Bruce could cheer me up after this movie. I have yet to see any Ed Wood or Uwe Boll but I think I'm amped for them now. For i can't even fathom a movie worse then . . . GAG . . . 'Hangmen' . . .\n",

Underdog sets about saving the city while attempting to keep his identity secret - a challenge given that he can both talk and fly.

      "Purportedly this is the final film of the Left Behind series which is fundamentalist preacher and novelist Tim LaHaye's idea of what we can expect in our future in the final days of Planet Earth. If this is the case we can expect an activist presidency in every sense of the word if Barack Obama becomes president next year.  The Fantastic Four of Revelation are all back with one cast change  Arnold Pinnock who most would know as the guidance counselor in Life With Derek  is now the minister taking the place of Clarence Gilyard. Brad Johnson as the anti-Christ's pilot by day and Christian by night is there as his daughter Janaya Stephens and ace investigative reporter Kirk Cameron. These are the only four people on Earth who have divined the true nature of UN Secretary General Nicolai Karpathy and once again are throwing sand in his machinery.  This time they've got as an ally the President of the United States who is played by Louis Gossett  Jr. He's having one hell of a rough time  especially the guerrillas launch on RPG attack on a presidential motorcade killing Vice President Charles Martin Smith. That's right  the Toad is Vice President. Somebody really messed up bad here because everyone including those who would do them harm know a President and Vice President NEVER travel together.   It takes all of them the entire film to convince Gossett exactly who Karpathy really is. Once again the best one in the film is Gordon Currie as Karpathy.  We may yet see another Left Behind film yet  the door was left open though people assure me that they've run out of source material from Tim LeHaye. I suppose as long as they make money and these players can't get jobs in the mainstream film industry. And there are some unresolved plot issues involving Brad Johnson and Chelsea Noble who is Mrs. Kirk Cameron in real life.   One of the Fantastic Four does die in this film  so will it be the Fantastic Three or will they get another fourth. Stay tuned.\n",

      "My God  the things that passed for entertainment in this country...  This is *not* the Tom and Jerry you may have enjoyed on Saturday Mornings  featuring a hapless cat and a clever mouse. This is a much earlier animation series  featuring a pair of Mutt-and-Jeff clones who get themselves into various scrapes that result in any of the then-typical dancing-skeleton-type gags that made up so much of early animation.  This particularly vile outing  apparently originally intended as a vehicle for a pair of actual black stage comedians of the time  has the pair crashing in the ocean while flying to Africa  necessitating black-face make-up  exaggerated negro dialect and Feets  don't fail me now situations.  It only shows that in the 70 years between emancipation and this film  the American view of Africans hadn't progressed much. Then again  at least one of them apparently had a pilot's license.\n",

      "Bizarre. This movie is supposed to be based on a famous photographer  but everything that happens in this movie is fiction. I guess it tries to explain why Diane Arbus had a fascination with oddities and made it her primary photography focus. In the movie  wolfman moves into the apartment above hers. She seemingly becomes obsessed with him and falls for him. She puts her kids and husband second over the wolfman  and even tries to incorporate him into her family gatherings. Some of the wolfman's freak show side kicks come over to visit and she mingles with them. The whole thing is very bizarre.  FINAL VERDICT: Nothing memorable. There is just something weird about a woman who gets her jollies from shaving the wolfman. I think you can find better films out there.\n",

The acting is not a bit better of that in soap operas  I guess the writer and director has seen too many Mexican soap operas and can't conceive anything remotely different.   Give it up  go back to your soap operas so that you have an audience to please.   Stop waisting our time and money and giving a bad name to the once respectable Mexican film industry.

      "I agree with Jessica  this movie is pretty bad. I'm surprised anyone took it seriously. Characters are one-dimensional  even the good guys and especially the bad guys. The only merit here is that it's so lame it's funny. Actually for me  there is the added benefit that it was shot in a state park not far from where I live  so seeing some local sights on the big screen is a hoot.  The lead character is a off-duty cop  and makes a big point of lecturing a good guy that vigilante justice is not just a bad idea  it's against the law. Imagine how long that lasts ...  Most of the movie's Northern California characters are blown-dried Hollywood cheese-balls  looking like they've never actually been in a fight. The story line is totally predictable. This film is ripe for a MST-3K lampooning. CAMP value only. I'm pretty forgiving of films in general  but seeing the old positive reviews I had to speak up. This is a dog. I give it a 3 out of 10  and then only for laughs.\n",

So I watched this movie with my brother and I must say  in the beginning it was very promising. Both of us really loved this brutal ball scene in the first scene. But i guess that was all. There are some interesting fights  but it is not a action movie  as it claims to be. Instead it's a love movie... with the cliché of love so extremely played over the top  even Shakespeare would vomit on this title. Sorry for my language.

      "A pointless cash-in with nothing to contribute except nastiness  this is a definite case of sloppy seconds for Robocop. Irvin Kershner's numbing  plot less and tired mess of a sequel is watchable and even mildly entertaining in a dubious  unpleasantly trashy way  but it has virtually none of the original's flair  emotion  intelligence or excitement. Instead we have just another empty spectacle of a blockbuster whose only reason to exist seems to be to nauseate the viewer with relentless violence  which is far more brainlessly gratuitous than anything in the original. Omni Consumer Products  who made the original Robocop cyborg  have turned into more of a totalitarian force than ever second time round  what with the suspicious Nazi-esquire banners  stormtrooper guards and tanks for hire at the end; as for the anonymous Old Man (Daniel O' Herlihy)  he's less of a benevolent protector and more of a hideous Mr. Burns type  surrounding himself with moronic lackeys who genuinely believe that putting the brain of a murderous psychopath into the body of the all-new Robocop 2 is a good idea. Oh  and the first Robocop gets a look in somewhere amidst all of this mess  though you wonder what on Earth a fine actor like Peter Weller saw in the script. The droll Tom Noonan has nothing to work with as the villain  while Nancy Allen is badly wasted as Robocop's partner. There are some hilarious moments throughout; the opening 'Magnavolt' commercial  for instance  but this is a poor follow-up to the truly great original.\n",

      "This sequel to In the Heat of the Night will suffer in inevitable comparisons to its infinitely better predecessor. Instead of looking like a theatrical movie edited for television  Mister Tibbs looks suspiciously like a TV movie edited for theatrical release  with grainy photography  cheesy opening titles  and sets that look like they're made of plywood. The murder sequence has a glaring continuity error: the camera shows two hands choking the girl  then a shot of a hand reaching for a statuette  then a shot of the girl being choked with two hands again  and finally the statuette coming down for the fatal blow. Solving the case should be easy: find the only guy with three hands! But the shoddy production values can't completely obscure this film's considerable merits: namely  Sidney Poitier's performance as the cool detective determined to follow the evidence wherever it may lead  even if it implicates a friend. Martin Landau is also convincing as the do-gooder preacher-activist suspected of brutally murdering his prostitute girlfriend. In addition to being haunted by the case  Tibbs is conflicted about his home life  but the issues of race and Tibbs' barely concealed sense of social outrage are absent here. So is the complex murder mystery that made In the Heat of the Night so compelling.\n",

      "How can you go wrong with a film that mixes the sophistication of Peter Cushing  the determination of Donald Pleasence and the bust of Luan Peters? Easy  you give them a terrible script to work with.  Peter Cushing  in an evil role  leads a Satanic cult that has captured a couple friends of Donald Pleasence. Donald plays a determined but aloof priest that desires to locate his friends but needs the help of Fred from Scooby-Doo to locate them. He summons the help of a New York bloodhound  who dresses just like the hero of the cartoon  in his task. Meanwhile  the girlfriend of one of the missing people  Luan Peters  joins the search. If all this sounds interesting  then you  like myself  were mislead.  It doesn't take long for the trio to sniff out the baddies but their methods of bringing the bad guys to justice are foolish. Also  women will find this a crapfest. Every time they get on the bad guys trail  our two male heroes tell Luan to stay at the hotel even though she can handle herself better than the squeamish priest played by Pleasence.  STORY: $ (The script really lets us down. No tension is built. No worthwhile dialogue is given the stars and you'll need both hands to count the number of times Luan Peters is told to stay behind and let men do men work. If you're interested in seeing a minotaur on film don't bother. We get a statue of a minotaur that spits flames).  VIOLENCE: $$ (There are some attacks and a few sacrifices  but those of you who drool for gore will be letdown).  ACTING: $$ (Even though there are three of my favorite actors in this film  there is nothing redeemable here. Peter Cushing doesn't have much screen time  Donald Pleasence is clearly aware that he is on the set of a stinker and Luan Peters is ill-used. This should have been much better given the talent involved  but then again  the Yankees lose a game here and there too).  NUDITY: $ (Luan Peters takes a bath but you see next to nothing. She isn't as obliging here as she was in The Flesh and Blood Show).\n",

      "The lines in the title of this review are the first lines in this film's theme song  a wonderfully demented parody of the (in my opinion horrible) song My favorite things from The Sound of Music. And this fun little detail isn't the only aspect that makes The Body Shop aka. Doctor Gore (1973) recommendable to my fellow Gore/Trash fans. The film  which was created almost entirely by J.G. Patterson Jr.  who served as producer  writer  director and leading man as the eponymous Dr. Gore  is crap  no doubt  but it is also beyond doubt that it is amusing  and that everyone involved  probably Patterson especially  was aware that they were not exactly making a masterpiece.  Dr. Brandon (Patterson) a famous but totally insane plastic surgeon  looses his beloved wife Anitra  a model  in an accident. Along with his hunchbacked assistant Greg (Roy Mehaffey)  he henceforth kidnaps beautiful young women in order to build himself a new  perfect wife out of their body-parts...  Doctor Gore is doubtlessly a film of the 'so bad it's good kind'  but it is also has qualities beyond the usual ridiculous trashiness. Mad science has always been one of my absolute favorite Horror topics  and  as a matter of fact  it is also one of the coolest topics for ridiculous Gore Trash flicks. Obviously shot on a minimal budget  Doctor Gore pays some homage to the Frankenstein films  especially James Whale's masterpiece Bride of Frankenstein (1935)  and resembles the look of the early Troma / Herschell Gordon Lewis Gore flicks such as Blood Feast (1963) - only that this looks a lot cheaper and crappier. Obviously J.G. Patterson's motive was not merely to make a fun gore flick: Being a rather ugly  weird-looking fellow  his role of Dr. Brandon gave Patterson the opportunity to make out with a couple of hot  scarcely dressed young women (who would later end up as body-part donors in Dr. Brandon's laboratory).  Most of the gore is actually pretty well-made regarding the obviously tiny budget. The dialogue includes some extremely hilarious lines (Get that  it might be the door... and put a coat on so they don't see you're a hunchback.). Besides the aforementioned theme song  Doctor Gore also includes a wonderfully crappy appearance by a country band called 'Bill Hicks and the Rainbows' - my new favorite band  NOT. For the rest of the film  I kept wondering whether Bill Hicks and Roy Mehaffey  who plays the hunchbacked assistant  are twins or even the same person - the two look exactly the same  and having two unrelated obese  red-bearded guys looking this weird in one film would be a huge coincidence. Other than J.G. Patterson  most of the cast members never did any other films. This is the first film I've seen out of the few by Patterson. Sadly  the man died of cancer in 1975.  Overall  Doctor Gore is a film that certainly isn't for everyone. As a matter of fact  it is total crap. But it is also amusing  and recommendable to my fellow fans of weirdness and cheap camp stuff. Dictionaries should show a screenshot from this film under 'trash flick'.\n",

      "The Vindicator is a weird little Canadian B-Movie. At first glance it would appear to be just another cheap (extremely cheap!) Terminator knockoff  but strangely enough it also shares some qualities with the original RoboCop  which hadn't even been released yet when Vindicator appeared (1986). Coincidence? Who knows? Anyway  the story is thus: scientist Carl Lehman seems to be a pretty nice guy who works for a super duper secret government high-tech research lab  reporting to a sleazy boss named Whyte  whom he butts heads with about project funding early in the movie. Carl's got a loving wife at home and a baby on the way  which makes it all the more tragic when he is suddenly killed in a lab accident. But wait! Carl's not really dead after all! Whyte has extracted Carl's brain and inserted it into his pet project  some sort of experimental bio-mechanical space suit. When Carl wakes up inside his new body  he understandably goes a little nuts  trashes the lab  and escapes. This is a problem because Whyte (for reasons known only to himself) has programmed the mechanical suit with a Rage Reaction program  which will cause Carl to kill anybody who touches him for any reason. In hindsight  that little addition to Carl's psyche was probably not the best idea.  So Robo-Carl wanders aimlessly through the movie for a while  killing a couple of random muggers and other assorted background characters  till he returns to his home and contacts his wife (this scene is supposed to be heartbreakingly touching  I guess  but turns out comical because Carl's robot voice is so heavily synthesized that you can barely understand a word he says). He of course tells her to leave the city and never come back because she's in danger  but she wants to stay and help him  yadda yadda yadda. Eventually Whyte hires a gang of commando thugs led by Hunter  an apparent ninja assassin played by Pam Grier (!)to hunt down and destroy his runaway creation  using Carl's wife as bait  and predictable (but laughably cheap looking) mayhem ensues.  I'm a B-Movie kind of guy but The Vindicator was so half-assed that it turned into high comedy pretty quickly. I'm assuming that a good hunk of the budget went into Stan Winston's robo-Carl suit design  because that actually looks pretty cool  but the rest of the movie suffers from a cheap  made-for-TV kind of look. The script could've used a LOT more work  but then maybe the filmmakers had gotten wind of RoboCop going into production and rushed to get Vindicator out so they couldn't be accused of ripping them off. Either way  judging by the other comments here on IMDb  I'm not the only one who's noticed the parallels between Vindicator and RoboCop  and obviously Robo is the superior film  so there's no need to waste your time sitting through this piece of nonsense unless you want to see a film that can best be described  at best  as a rough draft of RoboCop if it were made by an 8th grader.\n",

      "It seems incredible that the same decade which brought Star Wars to the silvery screen disgorged such unutterable tripe as this and many other 'adventure' movies. I am reminded of the similarly lavish  but equally wretched 'Ashanti' outlined elsewhere.  Whatever motivated A-list actors to sign-on for such wastes of celluloid is frankly beyond this writer. They must have been very  very desperate. To be perfectly candid  Roger Moore's appearance in any movie is the kiss of death. Although extremely handsome in his youth  his entire acting career has been predicated upon an ability to raise one eyebrow. Every emotion from A to B is conveyed by this simple stratagem. His were the dog-days of James Bond. Lee Marvin on the other hand has featured in some very worthy outings  perhaps most memorably 'Paint Your Wagon' and 'The Dirty Dozen'. He has a comic streak  but he is much better when he plays it straight.  The excellent Ian Holm is a throwaway  hardly recognisable blacked-up as a mute African. Everyone else just turned up for their pay-cheques.  The only plausible and watchable element is the German cruiser. It looks like a very large model. But it is believably massive and appears authentic - as do its crew. The rest isn't even hokum. The childish comedy jars with the brutality and violence in a story that meanders clumsily about  as if the script itself had had too many whiffs of Lee Marvin's gin. Here is a director who simply doesn't know where he's going. There are hints of 'The African Queen'  a snatch from 'The Pride & The Passion'  'Gold'  and one or two other rip-offs from movies who's titles don't come readily to mind.  Strangely  I have seen it 3 times  each occasion it has been shown on television when I have been laid low with a cold or the flu. Perhaps that is influencing my judgement - but not much.  Compare it with any Indiana Jones movie and you will see what I mean.  I have given it two stars; one for the battleship and the other because it finally comes to an end  though heaven knows it takes long enough to do that.  Time for another Lemsip  I think.\n",

      "After reading other reviews on this site  we weren't sure if we were going to be able to critique this movie because it didn't sound bad enough. However  2 minutes into the movie  we knew we were in for another flop. No summer is complete without ice cream  but this movie served up a melted  sour  broken-bottomed ice cream cone (you know  the kind that leaves you sticky and dirty and looking for a wet-nap). The biggest problem with this movie was the plot. What was it? It appeared to be a psychotic ice cream man driving around the neighborhood. That's it. Nothing else happens. First of all  what are the qualifications for becoming an ice-cream man in this crap town? 1. Spend several years in the most ridiculous mental hospital known to man. This hospital was plagued with clowns  graffiti  fake plastic sunflowers  and oversized syringes to the head. 2. Have extremely poor hygiene and a mutant face to scare the kids away. 3. Make sure your truck is stocked with severed body parts  roaches  and don't forget the eye whites!  The actors in this movie are pure B-Movie caliber. Mixed in with a bunch of unknowns is  who other than....a trailer-trash version of Macaulay Culkin!! Even his bratty charm couldn't save this kick in the pants. There seemed to be no rhyme or reason for any of the murders in this movie. The whole concept of the movie reeked! Who would kill an ice cream man in a drive-by shooting? Gangsters? Fiends? Vanna White? Who? We are still struggling with this question.  Whoever was in charge of the wardrobe for this movie should be immediately blacklisted from Hollywood. Did they honestly think a pillow under a kid's shirt would make the audience believe that he was really fat? Did they forget about the arms  face  legs  and all other body parts? Second of all  this movie was made in 1995  yet the wardrobe seemed to be picked from a lame 80's movie  evidenced by the big brother's white  crotch-hugging high-water pants.  While we were watching this shotty production  we both developed severe cases of ADD. We found ourselves leaving the room to walk around aimlessly. At many points it the movie  we found that staring at a blank wall behind the T.V. set was more entertaining than the actual movie. We were stunned that this movie didn't make it to the Bottom 100. Afterwards  we took the tape out of the VCR and left it on the black top to melt like a sub-standard ice cream cone.\n",

There were two scenes that just stuck out like a sore thumb. The first one was at the beginning of the movie when Marian Crane (Anne Heche) was sitting at her desk. Her boss took his client into his office because it was air conditioning. I imagine that the majority of Arizona businesses have air conditioning. The other was the meeting of Lila Crane (Julianne Moore) & Sam Loomis (Viggo Mortensen). Lila sporting the Walkman seemed like an exaggeration to update the movie.

      "Killer Flood: The Day the Damn Broke: 1/10: Finally a movie whose title is spoiler proof. Even by the low standards of disaster movies  excuse me allow me to correct myself  even by the low standards of made for TV disaster movies this is truly awful. Where do I begin?   The dam modeler may have once seen a photo of a dam but I doubt it. Most dams  especially large ones that generate electricity have oh I don't know a power plant nearby  some sluice gates for water to run through  heck even a high tension electrical wire or two.   The dam is also somewhat understaffed. Two  count them  two employees staff the entire dam  all three shifts. And the employees were apparently imported from a clichéd ridden world war two film  as they heroically and rather needlessly have long eulogized death scenes complete with photos of grandchildrenn floating by. Heck one of them manages to get shot by the dam itself in a way that defies description.   The special effects consist of flowing water superimposed on photo's of the town in a method that makes a sixties Godzilla film look like the Matrix. A three-year-old drawing with a blue crayon on the film stock would have yielded better results. Since the disaster money shots are worthless how is the rest of the film?   Needless to say the script and acting follow the special effects lead. This is no diamond in the rough. This is the rough. So is it a guilty pleasure? Killer Flood is awful enough to generate some laughs and the film itself has that earnest incompetence that makes a good cult classic  but bad disaster films need to age like a fine wine. (Avalanche  The Swarm  Meteor) It is also doubtful that Michelle Green hiding from the flood in a dumpster with a golden retriever will ever match the great Henry Fonda being pelted by raisins that are supposed to be killer bees.

There's a sudden appearance by a nice looking Canadian woman (Kathy Ranheim) who in real life was a star athlete in Alberta  for no other reason to ensure Canadian content. Credits also indicate that certain Calgary pubs were of assistance.  Everything here is poorly filmed and at least third-hand (chunks of poorly digested Trainspotting  Lock Stock  Snatch and Reservoir Dogs are the most obvious steals).

      "Not one of Monogram's better(not trying to be amusing here either)Chan entries. The Shanghai Cobra has a lot going for it  but  in the end  is just way too confusing and cluttered to be overly satisfying. The film opens with a murderer named the Shanghai Cobra having already struck twice and now is about in a scene at a diner in some way. We have a guy  a girl  and another guy having some implied connection when one guy dies in the streets. Yes  I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity  for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real  fulfilling explanation. I haven't even gone into the diner cook who has some involvement and a juke box that talks to you and has a screen and everyone doesn't seem to have a problem with that! All this is in the first five minutes or so. Then Chan enters film working for the government and flying out to help a friend. He also has right to check a bank's store of radium and is looking for a man wrapped in bandages that he helped arrest in Shanghai many years earlier. I found the plot very involved as stated earlier. Toler is back as Chan. He is ever affable. Benson Fong and Mantan Moreland are back too. Both do good jobs and are quite amusing. But the convoluted plot just didn't convince me  and much of the film was watched with a weird  questioning glance. This isn't a bad movie not just a very interesting one except for the most devoted of Chan fans.\n",

      "I'm new to Argento's work  and if this and Suspiria are any indication  then Argento is much more a filmmaker of experience than story. In his films  characters are placed in grueling and mesmerizing horror contexts that literally saturate the logic of the world around them. The camera literally flows gracefully through sets as the characters run  stumble  and choke their way to an eventual horrifying conclusion. It worked  REALLY well  in Suspiria. For some reason it didn't work here.  The problem I see with this movie is that even though the protagonist gets help by way of contacting the police and asking for help from her friends  it still feels as if she refuses to get help in terms of actually trying to find a solution to her problem. The entrapment in this film is that she's trapped in the killer's little game  one that she could easily get out of by... not setting herself up so easily? In a weird way it seems like the character wants the torture the killer gives her  which in a way is the point and could have worked except that the whole psychology of it is thrown about mostly due to whatever Argento feels like doing.  As a loving homage to The Phantom of the Opera  it's certainly an interesting and unique take. For all his worth  Argento delights in operatic movements as well  which well highlights the action. It just doesn't make much sense  especially as it delves further into a completely useless ending (yes  I know it's a reference to Harris' novel Red Dragon. No  it didn't work). Why the character should go from one horrifying experience of entrapment to a willing one with the director is beyond me. It felt almost self-serving on Argento's part.  Overall  a fun experience  and between this and Suspiria I'm more than willing to follow up on more Argento productions. But this is not a movie I'd want to return to or remember.  --PolarisDiB\n",

      "Greetings All   Isn't it amazing the power that films have on you after the 1st viewing ?  I was so delighted by the first viewing of this film  I couldn't stop talking about Flatliners to all my friends for weeks - mind you I was a very impressionable 18 year old back then and my taste in films have become a little more conservative since then.  Then somehow I forgot about this film until I saw the DVD in my local department store and remembering how great it was I thought Right ! I'll pluck you off the shelf when they bring out the Special Edition.  Last week  I was overjoyed when my best friend invited me over to watch Flatliners on DVD. The expectation was that I would love this film even more on 2nd viewing.. How wrong I was !  Verdict: after 11 years my view on this film had changed from a very scary 1st class movie to total junk which overplays on the religious and supernatural side of things ratherly superficially.  I have never been a big fan of Julia Roberts' acting (excepting for Erin Brockeridge in which she deserved her Oscar) I think the problem with this film definitely lies with the director and a so so mediocre script. I left this film feeling it had no real substance or potential  and just a couple of scarey cheap thrills which weren't very well done at all. Not even the score by James-Newtown Howard  who I rather like as a film composer  could captivate and thrill me.  In 1990 I would have given this film 9.5 / 10; but in 2001 I'd be lucky to give it 2 / 10 at best.  \n",

      "This is the second addition to Frank Baum's personally produced trilogy of Oz films. It's essentially the same childishness as in the other two pictures  although I consider it preferable to the others because it's shorter. As in the other films  there are performers in animal costumes  an adult woman pretends to be a boy  and the characters and plot jump all over the place while the camera-work is static. This time  at the centre is a magic cloak that grants wishes  and the boy played by a woman is made a king.  Most of the special effects are witnessed at the beginning. Fairies are represented by multiple-exposure photography. And  there's a man in the moon that looks just like those made by Georges Méliès years before  most famously in 'Le Voyage dans la lune' (1902). Méliès' imaginative fantasies and creative trick effects made him the leading pioneer of early cinema  and the films he made around the turn of the century were far better and even technically more advanced than this trifling Oz series.\n",

      "While there is a lot to recommend about Maetel Legend both in concept and finished product  it's ultimately a poor film. Plot wise it's a retelling of Maetel's early life  which is usually unclear; at the same time the writers take the opportunity to tell the story of the Machine Empire. And since Leiji Matsumoto has trouble not including his other work we get a starting point for Emeraldas her sister  Her mother: the Queen of La Metalle and a bit of Galaxy Express 999 to flesh out the film.  In short Maetel is a princess on the planet La Metalle  a planet with an irregular orbit  thus meaning its cycle around the nearest sun is reaching a cold stage and it's artificial Sun is dying. The Planet grows increasingly colder throughout the story  thus increasing the sense of doom. In order to protect her subjects and family the Queen decides that mechanisation is the only way to ensure survival of La Metalle's people. Enter Lord Hardgear  a robot / cyborg who provides the means for the job. Through the film  the characters are left to question mechanisation  will they still be human? Can Hardgear be trusted? Do souls and hearts remain? So for a fan of Matsumoto's work  there's lots to enjoy  questions to be answered  themes continued  except it's obvious that the film is meant to be an introduction  as well as a fan curiosity. The negatives  foremost the animation  while Galaxy Express 999  a TV series from over 20 years ago has shoddy mouth animation and at times sketchy character design  Maetel Legend has all the worst traits of modern animation and thus earns an air of respectability to Galaxy Express 999. The design is well detailed but unfortunately the animation has suffered leaving well drawn characters that 'slide'  as in the backgrounds move or the camera zooms  a quick way of animating. However the few  yes few well animated scenes are re used over and over in dream sequences  repetition and in extra scenes. Anyone who's seem the film will wonder how many times Lord Hardgear can drink the same glass of wine.  Next the story  While in concept everything sounds great  the finished product is in fact a series of conversations of plot which are repeated over and over to little effect  the number of times the characters encounter the same problems and learn the same things is practically insulting to the audience and the characters  which are seemingly much more articulate in former incarnations. Add to all of that some terrible character design  that seem lifeless  over exaggerated  and the audience is left with a movie so miss handled it might as well have been rewritten as a different film  at least the newcomers wouldn't be left baffled.  And yet  it really has its moments  the ending at least is surprising. The plight of the citizens of La Metalle was quite affecting and rightly disturbing; I guess I find that whole man-machine theme distressing. It's hard know who to recommend Maetel Legend to  since it's not well animated  written or executed  plus confusing once Leiji Matsumoto's mandatory cross-referencing is introduced. However I can't help but brighten up when the magnificent entrance of Three-Nine occurs  now that's good cinema.  1/5 stars out of 5  2 if you're a fan.\n",

      "Big (and we mean plus sized big) baddie Sebastian Cabot is trying to run salt of the earth farmers off their land in order to get the oil rights. When sea faring Sterling Haden's pop is killed  how will Haden put an end to TERROR IN A Texas TOWN  armed only with a harpoon?   First off  this isn't a B-western. There are no singing cowboys  no daredevil stunts  no interesting action sequences. It's just an independent movie -- you know  the ones that use unimportant actors to say important things and cover the general low budget vapidity of the goings on with Interesting Camera Angles.  Second  this movie  to avoid compromises (one expects) that would cause the elimination of Trumbo's Important Statements about Justice in America  and the rather sick relationship between the chief henchman and his girl  IS really low budget. The main problem that causes is that the acting is really  really bad. Sterling Haden is decent enough in tough roles  but he is the last guy you want playing a sensitive Swedish sailor gone to find his fortune in the West. Sebastian Cabot tries to do a Sydney Greenstreet as (very) bloated plutocrat. It's not a bad idea  but Cabot does not have the acting chops for it. The guy who plays the hired gun with the missing arm and soul (Johnny Crale) has the best role in the film. He does nothing with it.  Third  the script really isn't all that. Trumbo gets some digs in about the immigrant isn't going to get a fair shake from the sheriff in a corrupt town  and the people  when up against real oppression tend to back down. This is a pretty stale movie message by 1958 -- High Noon  Bad Day at Black Rock  Devil's Doorway -- are all Westerns that deal with the evils of Western society with an eye to the evils of 50s America. Trumbo  in '59  certainly had every personal reason to agree with those sentiments  but he isn't doing anything new or interesting with them.  So  given all the negatives  why does this movie get a 4? Mostly because there are interesting quirks throughout the movie. (The relationship between Crale and his girl is  um fascinating.) And Trumbo  while a mediocre writer when pursuing his political affectations  is very good in creating both interesting characters and intelligent interactions between them. Just when one is ready to pass out from Indy movie boredom  will come an exchange of dialog or simple quirkiness that gets one realize that guy writing the script was not simply a hack.  If you don't like Trumbo or westerns  give this one a miss. Otherwise  try it. You might like it more than I did.\n",

      "It is definitely not worth spending either money or time. It is the same hackneyed plot of a guy and a girl meeting and falling in love. But this is with a western touch. But it fails miserably in either depicting a love story or giving it the western touch. Never do we feel that the hero and heroin are in love. There is no depth to either of their characters. Probably  with a better cast  some justice could have been brought about to the characters. Finally  it is a movie with no fun  no acting  no theme  no plot  no comedy   no action  no thrill  no romance (i associate romance to something more passionate). Definitely not a movie you would want to go with your family. Overall  if you are looking for a movie with some content  this is definitely not an option.

      "Oh yes  I have to agree with the others who describe this as appalling. The acting in this four hour feature is uniformly bad  so bad to the point that I find it impossible to believe any of the actors in this production could possibly earn a living as an actor. I still wonder who did the casting. Each delivers their lines without appearing to have any kind of engagement or emotional investment with any other character. None appear to have a true relationship  family or otherwise  with another. The direction is also appalling and any action scene is laughable and unconvincing. Were the film editors asleep?  The costumes appear authentic to the Regency period but the fabrics look 20th century and colors (especially the blue colors!) are jarring and I don't believe were available in early 19th century fabric except perhaps in silk.   Also the hair: the men have obvious 1970s haircuts  and the women have big hair---especially the woman playing Anne Elliot.  All the female characters  young and old  are quite lovely but this doesn't make up for the lack of acting abilities. The actress playing Anne looks as though she is in her forties while Anne Elliot is supposed to be 27 years old. I mean  where was the makeup and lighting crew if we were to find the woman playing Anne believable? She spends much of her time gazing pensively with her eyes at the level of the horizon whether indoors or out. I wonder still what that was suppose to convey. Regret perhaps? Yes  this production is regrettable!  The actress playing Louisa was truly appalling. She screams  squeals  giggles  and leaps around like an ill mannered twelve-year-old (my apologies to anyone twelve years of age reading this) that I found myself eagerly awaiting the moment when she knocks herself out. How this behavior is suppose to attract an adult male is beyond me. Most would back off when she first opened her mouth to giggle and shriek.  The actor playing Captain Wentworth portrays someone so bland and colorless one wonders why any woman could pine over him for eight years.  The rejoining of the pair at the end is not convincingly done or explained. How did they get together again? Not because Louisa was in a coma; that is certain. No  there has to be more than that and it is not explained in the film.   I rate this production two stars: one because it is Austens' work  and the other because some of the outdoor scenes were lovely. The only reason I could watch the entire production is that I was off sick with the flu and I got it from the library.   If you enjoyed the book see the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I would recommend this film even if you have't read the book.\n",

      "Having not read the original book or seen the earlier film  and indeed knowing nothing about the storyline of either of those or the current film  I came to this film with an open mind.  It's really difficult to know where to start a comment on the film  because the whole thing seems so confused. It seems like there is a point or a message or something in the film  but what that is remains completely obscure.  The effects were fantastic and very well judged. The idea was set up really well with the motivation for time travel clearly made out. However  it was downhill from here.  All of the time travel seems to have only the vaguest connection to the quest that was set out at the start. There are some nice ideas  but they seem to be isolated occurrences that really do not flow and make the film seem disjointed and lost. At one point one wonders whether the main story in the film is the fate of the moon.  When Hartdegen arrives in 802 701 A.D.  the film becomes very frustrating as he seems to be unable to discover anything of importance about the Eloi  and while it seems clear that there is something to find out  what it is remains annoyingly elusive. This is quite an odd change from the previous time travel instances and one wonders why all of this has suddenly been abandoned for what seems like a completely new story. So many things happen that there should be an explanation for  but there is no discovery. I really  really wanted to know what the film was getting at  what there was to uncover  but to no avail. Having read a summary of what happens in the book at this point  it seems like there has been a very half-hearted attempt to render this in the film but it has been so simplified and dumbed down that the meaning and context is completely lost.  Just as we hope that we are finally to discover where this is all leading  the film suddenly takes another significant change in direction  and becomes a mindless action film without any real action. It is as if by this point the director has simply given up bothering to put any meaning into the film. By now countless significant things are happening without any explanation. Hartdegen fails to take the opportunity to return to the past on two occasions for no reason  and then suddenly loses all interest in time travel for no reason. The film comes to an abrupt end as Hartdegen decides to stay with the Eloi.  In summary  after a good start the film is very disappointing. Too much time is spent on Hartdegen's adventures before arriving with the Eloi. However  the worst part of the film is what I think is the most important part: the setting up of the situation with the Eloi. The whole point is completely missed  and this undermines the rest of the film. After this the film concentrates too much on effects and action and all attempts to return to the meaning and core of the film seem forced and out of place. With so many things happening without explanation  the film just seems to get lost and lose direction. However  the finale where Hartdegen decides he is no longer bothered about time travel is the most inexplicable of all.  Ultimately  the whole film seemed like a collection of unconnected incidents. The meaning and context was lost  although the gaping hole where it should have been was very obvious. What was so frustrating about it all  though  was that there was clearly so much potential here: it wasn't by any means a bad film  it just so easily could have been so much better. The start was very promising  the time travelling looked fantastic and would have worked had it not gone off on tangents  and Hartdegen's experience with the Eloi could so easily have worked had a few more of the right questions been asked  and had there not been such a temptation to dumb down and simplify. I just wish I had a time machine so that I could travel back in time and advise against the mistakes that were made.\n",

OK  it started out with Kayako who was an ordinary housewife who had an affair with some bloke and got herself dead. This part is still OK. Because of this moment of rage  she became a vengeful spirit who kills anyone who enters her house. Acceotable.

And to crown things all up  the ghost who was once depicted as a very vengeful one (In Ju-on: The Grudge  which was way better than this trash) is now depicted as some spectre who truly enjoys herself and felt that it is her mission to finish of people. Things became worse (For me  the viewer) when the ghost became coming in forms of large strands of hair. I mean  ??? If a ghost had such power  I seriously dun mind being one. I never really liked movies depicting ghosts as MONSTERS cause they're not. The overall results is just plain bad. Like The Grudge 2. With a better storyline and less exaggeration  this show would have been better\n",

      "i thought id check this film out as I'm currently making a film about a mysterious box  therefore it would be great to see how this film took and developed the idea of a mysterious and unexpected box.  before going to the cinema i had a high expectation of this film. with actresses  like Cameron diaz you would expect the acting especially hers to be great. the acting was a sort of let down for the film  the characters accents changed throughout the film it made it unbelievable.  the whole idea of a weird box that can make your dreams come true but destroy others is such a brilliant story but i feel the director let it down  this film had potential it could of been a lot lot better than it was.  this film had no middle to it. it was too confusing and needed a steady storyline. nobody wants to go into the cinema and come out thinking what have i just watched 'i didn't get it at all ' sometimes it can be exciting and make people want to watch it again  but this film made people want to never ever want to hear of the film again. throughout watching i noticed that half the audience had left before the ending. i feel every single person had been let down watching this film because of the high expectations and how slow parts of the film was.  lets put the bad points to one side... i did like however the scene where the son is in the bathroom at the end. it was unexpected  it reminded me of a horror movie and the way it was put together made me imagine it and how devastating and scary it would of been to be in that position. the lighting and the effects made it look excellent  this scene looked slightly more 1990's than the 1970's that this film is supposed to be.  this film was confusing because it had so many different bits to it. parts that you would expect to be sumned up at the end where everything comes clear but it didn't  it totally went against an audiences expectations  even though leaving the film on a cliff hanger  not giving the audience a reason why things happen could work and do really well  but this one didn't  it was a creative  different unusual film i thought  it had potential could of been better  disappointed didn't enjoy it  wouldn't buy it on DVD to be honest.\n",

      "I don't much mind the factors that others here have objected to - acting  lighting and so forth. For the most part  these things were executed well enough to carry the film and put its points across. It's just a horror film  after all.  What bugged me were the points themselves. Because this is a deeply moralistic film  and its morality is deeply tacky. In fact it's actually fundamentalist Christian morality  and this is a fundamentalist Christian film. Look at the 'sins':   * Sutherland's character picked on a kid at school when he was a pre-teen  leading to his accidental death.  * Baldwin's character used masculine wiles  persuasion and good looks to shag quite a few women  some of whom he videotaped. Ooh  the swine! How unlucky for him that women are such passive  gormless creatures that they had no complicity in the matter.  * Roberts' character's dad came back from Vietnam a junkie  so ashamed to be caught shooting up that he kills himself. Yes  what a terrible sin! Why couldn't he have just become an alcoholic like all the others?  * and Bacon's character picked on another schoolkid. How awful! The fact that he was a child himself apparently counts for nought. Children  it seems  are divinely judged by adult criteria.  Well  maybe lots of people support this level of moral absolutism. It certainly seems to have gone unremarked in this movie's comments. Does everyone just buy this stuff? At least human laws treat children differently from adults  recognising that their ethical sense is partially-formed. This film has no such qualms  and I find that pretty objectionable. Ditto the notion that women are helpless  fluffy creatures before young men's evil lusts. Or that a Vietnam vet driven to drug addiction is so shameful that suicide is a valid option. Pathetic.\n",

      "THE OTHER is a supposed horror movie made during the 1970s. It is not to be confused with the similarly titled THE OTHERS  which starred Nicole Kidman.  The plot is as follows - a woman with strange supernatural powers teaches her twin grandsons something referred to simply as the game. One of these twin boys - Niles - is supposed to be good. The other one - Holland - is supposed to be evil.  The idea sounds interesting enough as an abstract concept and the movie was adapted from a novel. I can only hope the novel was interesting as the movie was incredibly boring from beginning to end.  The execution of this movie is very much like a TV movie of the kind UK residents might see on Channel 5. In fact  this movie looks like it was made to be the daytime afternoon movie for this TV channel. A slight trimming to one or two scenes and this would be a U-rated movie of the kind Disney produce. But even the youngest of children are more likely to be bored than scared by THE OTHER.  You don't need to check out the director's CV to realise horror is not his forte.  Mr. Mulligan relies heavily upon the characters to drive the story. This is obvious from the get-go. I haven't seen any of his other movies but TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a highly regarded crime movie on this site. Unfortunately in THE OTHER  the characters are given too little to do and the plodding script ensures the movie never really takes off in the way one might expect.  The direction is as bland as you could possibly find. Almost every single scene takes place in the daytime! Think about this - a scene shot in the open landscape in rural America during daytime with the camera focusing on vast area. Does it sound scary or atmospheric? Believe me  it isn't. It comes across as something more akin to an episode of LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE than a horror movie. And yes  both the aforementioned TV series and THE OTHER were shot in California.  There is a noticeable absence of danger or malice that makes the whole exercise seem rather pointless.  The ending was clearly meant to be highly disturbing and perhaps influenced that of another movie from this time period. I won't reveal which movie but I'll give 2 clues - a young boy was a main character and the movie is well-known. And I'll add that the concept was used to much greater effect in the latter movie.  The acting is actually quite good and is the only reason why I have awarded 2 stars. The actors playing the twin boys  along with the actress playing the grandmother  all try hard with the poor material they are given.  Diana Muldaur is completely wasted in a thankless role as the mother of the twin boys. Do not be fooled by her high billing on the cast list. She gets very little screen time and her presence just comes across as a ploy to cash-in on her long established TV career in order to help attract TV viewers.  I paid careful attention to the blurb on the back of the DVD cover (of the Region 2 version in the UK). Comparisons were made to THE EXORCIST  which I thought was a complete insult to that movie. There is no comparison. THE EXORCIST had everything this movie should contain but does not - suspense  tension  tongue-in-cheek humour  highly disturbing content  great acting  superb characterisation and viewer involvement. Ironically  THE EXORCIST was made only a year later but in terms of style and execution seems like decades ahead of the bland drama known as THE OTHER. THE OTHER comes across as a work that would have seemed tame in the 1950s let alone the 1970s!  The 1970s was a great era for horror movies with classics such as THE EXORCIST  THE OMEN  THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE  THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE  SALEM'S LOT to name just a few being produced. For this reason  THE OTHER proves an even greater disappointment.  If anyone finds the synopsis of THE OTHER interesting  they might want to read the book or do a little more research on what the book was about. I would advice everyone to skip the movie.\n",

Englund is just in it for a cameo and his performance is as unnecessary as most of the lame attempts at jokes (and scares). The direction is terrible and the acting is worse. It seems like every year producers are trying to make another Evil Dead but these weak unoriginal attempts are just stepping on the memory of a true horror classic.  Whether its filmmakers saying this isn't a remake but its an 80s throwback (which is just as unoriginal in my opinion - Hatchet) or people trying to plug this with other horror classics  Its still misleading and wont make up for the lack of scares  horror  comedy  or even a decent movie for that matter.

      "Hypothetical situations abound  one-time director Harry Ralston gives us the ultimate post-apocalyptic glimpse with the world dead  left in the streets  in the stores  and throughout the landscape  sans in the middle of a forgotten desert. One lone survivor  attempting to rekindle his sanity  takes food from the city to his bungalow in this desert. All alone  he hopes for more  but with nobody around  he is left with white underwear  and a passion for a local Indian tribe  until the discovery of a camera which opens up new doors and breaks the barriers of human co-existence. Alan  a man of the book  is left on Earth after an unknown disaster. Thinking he is alone  he begins living life his way  until  Jeri Ryan  appears (like she would in any dream) out of the woods  disheveled  and unhappy to find the final man alive to be ... well ... like Alan. Anyway  they try to co-exist  fail  get drunk  and before creating the ultimate dystopia  they run into Redneck Raphael (played by newcomer  Dan Montgomery Jr). Bonds are torn  confusion sets in  a couple becomes a third wheel  and the battle between physically inept nerd vs. brainless jock. Even with nobody left on the planet  it becomes a truth that even the darkest of human nature will arise.  Using a variable film technique  Ralston gives us a mediocre story based loosely on another film entitled The Quiet Earth (which I will be viewing next) oddly which he never gives any credit towards. With a borrowed story  I guess he does a decent job of reinterpreting it. His punch seems to be lacking at the beginning while Ralston tries to find his stride  borrowing yet again from other film director's techniques to attempt to find his own. He opens the film interestingly enough  but fails to answer any direct answers. Sure  the final days have arrived  but could there be a concise answer as to how or better yet why these select few survived. A spookier beginning would have led us stronger into a comical film. The juxtaposition would have been like Shawn of the Dead  but instead left us feeling like we were watching a made-for-TV program. Listening to the audio commentary  I have respect for Ralston because he worked diligently to get this film made  and his passion nearly sells the film  but you could tell from his interaction with the cast that he wasn't as happy with his overall final product. There were mistakes  ones that he pointed out and others that he was ashamed to point out. While this does make for decent independent film-making  it sometimes feels cheap  and in Ralston's case  it was the latter.  I must admit  David Arnott's portrayal of Alan hooked me. He played that wimpy  school nerd  adult role very well. He was funny to both watch and listen to  and thus he became sympathetic to the viewer. He was a key player in keeping the film together  alas  I cannot say the same for the rest. This was Dan Montgomery's first film  and it was obvious  I mean  really really obvious. There were scenes in which I thought the cue card was about to come out and read the lines for him  perhaps even giving us a more realistic performance  but alas  it wasn't the case. Then there was Jeri Ryan. She pulled into her character near the end of the film  which to me  was the culmination of the entire piece of art. She goes from estranged unknown to bitter cranky insane girlfriend by the end. Confused? Again  she fell into her character by the end  giving us just a glimpse of what she could have probably done as her acting matured. Even as the commentary progressed  all that she contributed was a laugh  giggle  or ohhh  look at that color moment. While her beauty may sell tickets  one may want to consider knowledge to be just as beautiful. This was her first film  so can I be too harsh?   Overall  this film felt like it was missing something. I though the idea was strong  the premise that even with only a peppering of people remaining on the Earth the evil of human nature still exists. Jealousy cannot be killed by bacteria or bombs (maybe because it is consumed by zinc?) and we as a race will always want what we cannot have. Ralston is not a surprising director  his techniques are flawed and pre-used  but he does know how to make a low-budget comedy. I think our idea of funny is different  so that is why I couldn't find myself laughing at many of the bits he found hysterical. His actors provided the level of acting needed for this film  which was lower than average. His film was loose  meaning that there were elements never quite explained or tackled (i.e. anything with wings survived?!?)  which overall harmed the intensity of the film. This was a comedy  but it could have been much darker and much much funnier. For those thinking that Roger Avery was a huge element to this film  as we learn from their commentary  all he was there for was money  the was in essence  the bank for The Last Man. Don't get your hopes up for any classic Avery moments.  Don't expect more from Ralston  and that is how I will end it.  Grade: ** out of *****\n",

      "The film's executive producer is none other than that messenger of peace thru transcendental meditation  David Lynch  the director's father. I wonder what David's guru  His Holiness Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  would have thought of this production. The hypocrisy here is as repugnant as is the film itself. It's a safe bet that Samuel L. Dieteman  Phoenix serial killer and devotee of recreational violence  would have loved every minute of it.  I doubt if many would fault this film for its cinematic craft; on that level it's quite good. But on a moral level  it's the most disheartening movie I've ever seen.  SPOILER COMING  I guess it's the phoniness of the thing that saddens me the most. Morally-numb Generation Xers learn a craft and a little post-modern aesthetic theory at art school or film school and then get involved in the arts-and-entertainment industry; and here's the result: a film which wallows in human suffering  injustice and carnage  much of which is witnessed by a nine-year old who sees her entire family brutally murdered by a couple of recreational-violence killers who  at the end  ride off into the sunset.  NO MORE SPOILERS COMING  For whom are films like this produced? Narurally  sadists are going to adore this - why wouldn't they? But who else? As I noted above  there's some really good film craft here  but good craft can be applied to any subject matter. Why apply it to stuff like this? Also  the movie is very suspenseful  but that's not because of the graphicness & grossness of the violence; it's suspenseful because it's well-directed & well-acted. I'm sure the ghost of Alfred Hitchcock could explain this much better than I can.  So what has been put before us here? And above all  why?   Yes  our world can be an ugly  dirty  even evil place  but shouldn't we dissent when an artist makes it her/his business to rub our faces in it? Or worse still  to stick it in the faces of those nine-year olds who will  one way or another  end up seeing this on home DVD?   I hope that people will see to it that this film is not seen by their kids. Yeah  I know - dream on  bernon...\n",

I spent a couple of years trying to find it online...didn't remember the title  only the storyline. After searching and searching  I came across a VHS that was being sold on E-Bay. I was excited and when it finally arrived  I jammed it into the VCR and couldn't help but feel a bit nostalgic. Needless to say  I was slightly disappointed. This wasn't the movie I remember watching as a kid. It was boring at times and I found Beryl Reid's incessant whinning extremely annoying.

The film revolves around impersonation (which seems to be in the curriculum of every comic star!) - in this case a German officer - and  while not as bad as Leonard Maltin claims (awarding it a BOMB rating)  it's not exactly classic stuff either - certainly leagues behind Chaplin's THE GREAT DICTATOR (1940)  even if comparably narcissistic! Ironically  the scenes prior to the appearance of the would-be wacky General offer more felicities than the rather forced humor at Nazi expense!

      "This is a little slow-moving for a horror movie  but the quality is better than you might expect for a director's only effort on IMDb. The camera work and lighting were both surprisingly good  and the acting  although variable  is better than is often found in Indie genre flicks.  As the lead  Robert Field is rather stiff  which is especially unfortunate given that his character  Claude  is the film's narrator as well as the centre of its action. However  it was the entry of Christopher (Brandon deSpain) that I considered the turning point of this film  and not in a good way. A twist is introduced in a clumsy fashion  and slow-moving becomes drawn out and overly wordy.  On the up side  Pete Barker is consistently entertaining as Father William. He's the easy stand-out in what is a fairly ordinary offering. While the first half hour caught my interest  I ended up feeling quite disappointed in the way things played out.\n",

      "Yes  Lifetime has a habit of making the male species look stupid. And this soap opera ain't kidding when they make Perry King  supposedly a well renowned medical doctor  unable to see the evil surrounding him. Puts your trust in doctors  huh? How can anyone not see what's going on? Is he that stupid? And the evil wife  with a face like a horse  goes around killing off his entire family without a trace. How does she acquire all the drugs? That isn't explained. How does she get off being a secretary in a hospital without any credentials? I guess the director  Don FauntLeRoy asks us to just believe it. I didn't. I kept yelling at the screen at the stupidity of King with all right in front of his face. If the wife was that attractive  maybe  just maybe  I'd accept it. But she's not even that. Shannon Sturges is the perfect wife and I tell you she has the face of a horse. I wouldn't cross the street for her  yet our perfect husband does and quickly. After everybody in the cast get knocked off  I wasn't satisfied with the come up pence given to our villainess. She deserved more than she got. William Moses plays the doctor's brother who unfortunately you know his outcome from day one. Pleasure to at least see one pretty face in this clinker. That of Lesley Anne Down.

      "I saw this movie with a friend who ran a marathon with me  and we both had the same feeling about it: it wasn't terribly motivating  and didn't even broach the idea of what a training schedule would look like  so that non-marathoners could have an idea of what it would take for them to train and run one. In fact there was almost zero technical information at all. I didn't expect this to be a tech-heavy instructional video  but when that info was near zero then the film just wasn't balanced  and wasn't particularly useful to non-marathoners contemplating their first run.  There were other problems. Some of the very first images were people collapsing near death while trying to run a race. Yeah  real inspiring. The timing was also hard to follow  because it was semi chronological  but the filmmakers rarely gave you any good clues as to what point in time you were looking at. And they withheld information. You see that Kantor has an injury  and you just assume it's from all her training  but then several scenes later they finally clue you in that it's because she tripped over a pine cone in her yard.  Some parts were very good  though  like the bit about a woman defying race officials who wanted the run to be men-only  and the coverage of a Chicago race where two of the runners portrayed earlier were vying for first place.  Off the top of my head  I'm thinking of other chronological documentaries  like Supersize Me  and Grass  where you always know where you are  and you feel like they told you everything you wanted to know.  In short  it wouldn't have been hard to make a better marathon film  and as it stands I can't recommend this to non-marathoners to educate and motivate them to try one  because I don't think it will have that effect.\n",

      "It doesn't surprise me that the makers of this hopeless movie couldn't find a UK distributor  and then had to release it as a free DVD with a Sunday newspaper. The distributors could clearly see what the film-makers and the Sunday newspaper couldn't  that this was one movie that just wasn't going to recoup its costs.  Since it's a thriller about riddles  it would have helped if they'd picked a lead actor who could enunciate properly  rather than the mumbling Vinnie Jones who appears to pronounce riddle as riell. And it would have helped if the dialogue hadn't been swamped by noisy locations or scenes flooded with distracting and inappropriate music. The plot is ludicrous: The lost Charles Dickens story supposedly helps our hero solve a series of modern murders  but so would a copy of Herge's Adventures Of Tintin  since the link between Dickens and Jones is more non-existent than tenuous. And we have the ridiculous premise that a would-be investigative journalist who lays his hands on a previously undiscovered Dickens manuscript  would take several days to read it  just so that flashbacks to Dickens can continue to be played throughout the movie  as if they had some connection to it. Which they don't. I mean  if you found a new Dickens manuscript  wouldn't you just go somewhere quiet and read it ? The film ends with one of those surprise revelations that have become mandatory since The Sixth Sense  but in this case it doesn't so much surprise you as insult your intelligence. If the film is suddenly going to turn supernatural at the twelfth hour  then revealing that Vinnie Jones is a robot might have been more acceptable. It might not have seemed so turgid if the film had been stylish  but it isn't. And in several places it appears decidedly amateur: There's a scene where a table is laid with a 60's jump-cut technique  but they haven't made sure that the person actually laying the table is completely out of frame between the cuts. Consequently  you can see things changing at the edge of frame  when you're really supposed to be watching things changing at the centre of frame. A good rule in movie-making is: If you don't understand how to do a technique then try something else.  The real riddle is why anyone thought it would be a good idea to make this movie in the first place.\n",

This movie had a potentially good story  but it was ruined with bad dialogue  continuity problems  things that were never explained  gaping plotholes  sub-plots that went nowhere  and just plain stupidity. Not to mention the awful  cliched directing of Sandra Locke. Not even two great performances could've saved this movie. So it didn't matter that Devon Gummersall and Rosanna Arquette give horrific performances. The thing is  they're better actors than this movie would have you believe. The best of the Arquettes  Rosanna Arquette (Silverado  After Hours  Desperately Seeking Susan) has some fine moments - like a great scene in the beginning when she painfully pulls her handcuffs off - but gives an overall weak performance  by her standards. And Devon Gummersall (Dick  When Trumpets Fade  and the brilliant My So-Called Life) is much worse  acting with no conviction or emotion what-so-ever.

Matt Dillon's character has been played a million times  a cop who had been hardened over the years and would see the light to some degree by the end of the movie. The predictability hardly ended with those characters. A phenomenal cast was wasted on a weak script. The morals of the story were PC to the max. There were a few clever twists but not nearly enough.

I won't even bother going into the plot as I defy anyone to follow it and make sense of the storyline. Maybe it's the television cut I watched  but I can't imagine any version being that much better.

To start with the good thing: The cinematography is stunning. The beauty of the Namibian desert shows itself as a merciless surrounding  also in the pictures. And then there is the acting. Quite allright. Jennifer Jason Leigh has never been better. Bruce Davison also seems to have developed his character from Altman's Short Cuts.  Then the disappointments: Janet McTeer. Romane Bohringer. And the plot. Why on earth does Levring pick Lear for their play? The whole idea of letting Shakespeare articulate their despair and inner longings does not work. It seems like a facade. And it is clear that the tragedies takes place because of the choice of Lear. They just needs to fit in in the Script by Levring and Academy Award winner Anders Thomas Jensen.  And the sex. It takes about three days  then more or less all of the characters are sexually frustrated. Dahh!! Sex is always the easy way out when you are in need of a crisis in a plot. Janet McTeer's part totally falls apart  mainly because of that ridiculous idea. The sex makes the plot fall promptly to the ground. Instead they could have focused on the dialogue. There must have been conversation between all of the characters  but we mainly see them talking in smaller groups. Their talking though is as dead as Lear and the rest of the film.  The King Is Alive still is not the worst Danish dogme '95 movie yet. But comparing it to the most recent of the homegrown dogme '95 films Italiensk for begyndere by Lone Scherfig  this one fails badly. It is not a good film. It is a bad one. But it is beautiful.\n",

The story begins with introduction to Soultaker  played by Joe Estevez. We quickly learn what Soultaker's role will be in this movie.  Next the college aged young people are getting ready for a summer festival  aptly named Summerfest. In this film  the battle of the classes is omni-present throughout the film. The girls come from a wealthy class  and the guys come from roughly middle or lower class. The class roles seem to play a role in the film for some reason which isn't really clear or pertinent to the story.  At Summerfest we learn more about the apparent class struggles of why Zach isn't encouraged to date Natalie. Soultaker makes an appearance as well  with apparently his boss the Angel of Death. Here D'Zar's character points out who is to die and who's souls are to be taken. It's revealed as well  that Soultaker will have a character conflict regarding Natalie  and how he deals with her because of someone in his past.  Meanwhile Natalie is ditched by her ride to Summerfest  and Zach convinces her to ride home with them. During the ride home  Soultaker takes an active role causing them to wreck horribly at high speeds.  The rest of the story surrounds the Soultaker collecting the souls of the dead passengers  and Zach and Natalie trying to outwit him to return to their bodies so they can continue to live. The class and character conflicts lay in the story  but are really never brought to the forefront or resolved.  There's an attempt towards the end to drag out some of the drama  there's a lot of chasing and running which does tend to be really boring. It's not really acceptable  and it would've been nice had this been dealt with differently  somehow to maybe increase the drama but not bore the audience.  The story and acting are decent. The soundtrack is OK  and even the production values are good.  Robert D'Zar in his brief on screen appearances does a nice job as the Angel of Death. Joe Estevez does OK  however sometimes his role acting a bit flat. Vivian is pretty and does a decent job as Natalie  although perhaps over acting a bit in a few scenes.  This may sound odd  but this movie definitely could've benefited from some pointless nudity. Vivian teases us a bit but that wasn't enough.  In my opinion this was a pretty serious attempt at making a movie. The results  it's worth watching. Just don't expect a perfect production.  3/10\n",

      "I thought this would be a fun comedy with no sex or nudity in it. Well  there's no sexual content but as for being a fun comedy  I only remember laughing a total three times during The Green Butchers. The hilarity is centered around cannibalism and mental retardation  which is just sick humor  in a bad way.  I should have walked out of this film and I'm kicking myself because I didn't. In fact  I shouldn't have seen this movie in the first place. The only good that came out of this film was was the fact that Bjarne and his brother finally made amends and put their ugly past behind them. I advise any well-meaning individual to steer clear of this gross-out flick.\n",

      "To start this movie was sick. Here your wife is dying and you go strutting around town with this blond chic by your side. Then your wife dies and within 2 months you are together with this chic. Hank (James Brolin) is definitely moving fast throughout this movie. I called him Fast Hank. Fast Hank marries this beautiful lady and before you know it she is having sex with his best friends. The part that gets me is when she is doing it in the barn with Kevin and gets caught by another one of Hanks friends. Kevin gets up and leaves  she drops her robe and BAM!! Right into the arms of this other guy and they start doing it right then and there. I guess he is finishing up what Kevin started. HOW GROSS!!!! I am like this is lifetime movie???

      "Oh If any day u wanna see a supernatural thriller turning out to be a comedy watch this movie  This film was a shocker as it had so many actors in it but what they do and how they fit in?  The handling of the college scenes is like a school play where each person comes talk and then the next person comes infront  Okay reasons to laugh at the film: 1) Akshay  Suneil  Aditya Panscholi  Sharad Kapoor  Arshad Warsi as college students 2)Akshay carries a gun in college 3) some pathetic stunts and SFX  there are several more flaws like why doesn't the snake save his lover from being raped and comes in so late? also why he doesn't kill all of them together there only?  But afterall they have to make a 2 hrs + film so hence you have a tortorius movie  The movie is painful to watch The film was directed by Rajkumar Kohli who was an expert making such films in the past and had a successful record of films like JAANI DUSHMAN(1979) and NAGIN Rajkumar Kohli wants to help his son's non existent career Right from VIRODHI(1992) Aulad Ke Dushman (1993) and QAHAR(1996) all flops he tried hard to promote his son and he also casts big stars so that his son gets noticed  sadly nothing could help his son's career  The film has several comical scenes like the death scenes  how the actors after being bashed by the snake are so fit to fight him again and the climax  Direction by Rajkumar Kohli is bad Music is bad  That brings us to the cast Akshay Kumar - ordinary stuff  he has nothing much to do rather then stunts Suneil Shetty- awful Sonu Nigam- the worst debutante award goes to him  he gives cartoon acting a new meaning Aftab- terrible Arshad Warsi- nothing to do Sharad Kapoor- bad Aditya Panscholi- irritates Sunny Deol- is comical in the scene when he comes to save Sonu LOL Manisha Koirala- ordinary Rambha- Akshay's pair Kiran Kumar  Raza Murad are as usual Raj Babbar- hilarious for wrong reasons the girls are awful Which brings us to Munish Kohli This guy has a huge physique  he is even more stronger and taller then Akshay Kumar Sadly he comes across as poor man's Akshay His voice is awful  his expressions are painful The only thing he has to do in the movie is wear glasses and make an evil face Rajat Bedi is awful\n",

      "I am finding that I get less and less excited about Disney's sequels to movies. Yes  I do understand that the budget for the direct to video movies are not the same  but these movies don't even try. Some examples are Hunchback II and Tarzan and Jane. If anyone has seen the previews for Stitch-The Movie  you will see my point. But I digress  this movie reaffirms my point. The animation is sloppy  the story lines resemble Saturday morning cartoons  and not all of the original voices are there. I was very disappointed not to hear Michael J. Fox's voice. It was so glaringly obvious that the person doing Milo's voice was trying to sound like Fox  but didn't come close to succeeding.

The hype and publicity were quite misleading.  I was expecting something very dramatic like Devdas. Understanding that the story and time-period demand it  I found the movie extremely slow-paced.  I'm a die-hard Aishwarya fan  and I regret to say that I thought she was miscast. The role of Chokher Bali required an actress who can portray herself as subversive  not innocent and naive. Everyone else gave a good performance. Tagore's depiction of the human condition does come across the celluloid to give the movie an interesting theme.\n",

      "The story  as I understand  is based on real events. That can be either good or bad  depending on what sort of license is taken with those real events and how they are rendered.  In this case  the results are enough to gag a maggot. I wasn't expecting much going in -- anticipating a story of rich high-school kids taking an ocean cruise under a stern skipper. That is  what I figured was a coming-of-age movie along the lines of something about boot camp or basic training  the kind in which the drill sergeant says  My duty is to snap you out of your winsome civilian ways. Well  it IS that  in a way. The kids start out as kids and end up as an organic group. But this is far hokier than any boot-camp movie I've ever seen  outside of a deliberate comedy. Who WROTE this thing? The air is filled with slogans that belong  not in high school  but in the third grade. The dialog offends the ear.  Jeff Bridges usually does a better-than-average job but in this case his performance is mediocre. He brings nothing extra to the part  although given his lines  it's hard to know how he could do much with them. The rest of the cast is undistinguished and a few of the kids are painfully inadequate. There's a lot of tearing up  and considerable crying. The best scene involves a dolphin.  The immature clichés continue to the very end. The Coast Guard is cast in the role of the hard-hearted court at the hearing that follows the disaster. The interrogator does nothing but hit Bridges over the head with his misinterpretations and misconstruction of events. You let the crew drink alcohol  didn't you? (A couple of harmless drinks.) And you didn't punish them  though you punished them for killing a fish. (The dolphin business.) The technical details surrounding the sinking are left murky. What is a white squall anyway? And if it's as dangerous as Bridges claims  why weren't the whole crew alerted and wearing life vests? But why go on? If The Albatross were a Dreadnaught  it would still be torpedoed and sunk by the ludicrous comic-book script.\n",

      "I have seen cheesy kung fu fight films. Living in Taiwan they come on in lieu of sitcoms in America. I have seen movies make fun of themselves  but this film belongs in the sad category of fight films that try too hard with awful actors  awful props  and awful music to be taken seriously. I seriously felt pity for the person who composed the music for this movie. How sad it must be to be a composer who has to churn out crap like what I thought should have been titled Generic Ninja Fight Scene  Op. 1 or Variations on A Bad Guy Pointing a Gun at a Girl's Head When Backed into a Corner or the daring Flight of the Helicopter. Then the fight scenes were over and the credits rolled. Those actually had me in tears laughing. If the special effects weren't proof enough that this was low-budget  the fact that only two or three of the crew members  presumably locals which although good for the much-needed Phillipino economy was probably done solely to save money  have ever done anything since this series of movies. They rented equipment  despite making sequels to this movie. That was pretty funny too. The thing that really had me going though  was not the music (which left me half expecting an animated Sargeant Slaughter from G.I. Joe to pop up)  but the ending...I suppose this would be a spoiler if there was really a plot to spoil  but when the American Ninja drops the girl into Jackson's arms and then takes off his mask  I wanted to see him jump off the roof and Jackson drop the girl to catch him.  I think that would have been the perfect punchline for this joke of a movie.\n",

While I remember Peter O'Toole  I was entirely oblivious to the fact that the female lead (okay  - she was little more than an object for discussion in the storyline) was Ms. Hemingway. I saw this movie back in the days when I wrote movie reviews  and warned people off it  as the stories just didn't work  and fifteen years of my subconscious trying to sort things out still hasn't made sense of the flow of the ideas.  Part of this may have to do with the fact that it looked like  after the original movie (whatever it was about) was filmed  an editor came in and tried to piece together something out of it. I don't know if this had been a project of a previous studio boss  and so was sabotaged to discredit him or her by the successor  or this was a disaster from the original screenplay that attempts to salvage were unsuccessful.

I usually enjoy dramas like Wall Street  Glen Gary Glen Ross  Boiler Room  etc...I went into this movie thinking I would be on the edge of my seat. Plus  I am a big Pacino fan.  What a piece of garbage. Quite possibly the worst movie I have seen in five years. This makes Pacino's debacle in Any Given Sunday actually look good. First  half the movie is watching Matthew McConaughey lift weights. OK  we get it. You are in shape Matt. We don't need to see every other scene with you pumping iron  shirtless.  Secondly  how many plot holes are in this movie? Why introduce the phone call from Brandon's long lost Dad and never address it again? What was the point of his Mom hanging up on him - why even have her call to say he is sending her too much money - what was the point of that? The guy from Puerto Rico who lost 30 million? Also  since sports betting is illegal in NY  and its acknowledged its illegal  how can they possibly guarantee everyone's bet at the end?   This was simply a very poorly written script. It had potential  but it was devoid of a coherent plot. I thought Pacino learned his lesson about script selection after Any Given Sunday  but apparently not.

The person also says we can tell he's constantly thinking. How can we do that? Well  do you know that joke How can you tell when a CEO/politician/lawyer is lying? ... His/her lips move.

The scientist decides to use his serum on a concert pianist to extort money from him for the cure as well as take the man's daughter for a wife  according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis. J. Carrol Naish (as Dr. Igor Markoff) plays The Monster Maker in the low budget Bela Lugosi mode.  Mr. Naish's serum causes a real disorder  acromegaly  which American Heritage defines as  A chronic disease of adults marked by enlargement of the bones of the extremities  face  and jaw that is caused by overactivity of the pituitary gland. Ralph Morgan (as Anthony Lawrence) plays the afflicted man with some dignity. Pretty blonde Wanda McKay (as Patricia Pat Lawrence) is the daughter desired by mad scientist Naish; in early scenes  Ms. McKay and Naish emote hilariously.  Watch for Tala Birell (as Maxine) in a surprisingly good supporting performance; she plays the somewhat Garbo-like  and long suffering  assistant to Naish. Ms. Birell definitely steals the film; and  you've got to question Dr. Markoff's sanity in casting her aside. Glenn Strange (as Steve) and a crazed gorilla (Ray Corrigan) add to the fun.

      "Watching this film today I got the feeling this thing was missing about 10 to 15 minutes or so from the beginning of the story. John Wayne rides up on this trading post/saloon out in the middle of nowhere to meet with the owner about some robberies. All he sees is the signs of a massacre  some dead bodies  signs of a fight and no one alive in sight. That's because the owner's daughter is hidden in a secret room  the kind you find in old English murder mysteries.  The reason you find those hidden rooms in those kind of stories is that they were formerly priestholes. Catholic families clinging to the old faith in 16th century England built these things to hide those on the run from royal authorities because of their faith. Not something you see in westerns  but a good gimmick.  Unfortunately because of bad editing or writing or both we never know exactly what brought Wayne to this place exactly. But this was a B western and not even a good one at that.  Gabby Hayes is in this and he's clean shaven and playing a mute part of the time. An unusual circumstance for the garrulous Gabby.

It's one of the few movies Dimension actually has not shelved (it's hard to come up with a reason why) and it was rushed into a an unimpressive 500 theaters it's opening day. Maybe Dimension was afraid of how people would respond to a swamp creature using his tow truck to pull a house apart piece by piece.

Cheerleader Massacre seamlessly combines bad acting  a horrible plot  a dumb killer  dull and boring deaths  boring scenery  and hideous camera work to make it one of the worst films ever made.

The film also fails to give a credible account of the Australian soldier and his behaviour in this event. It is more like an uninformed contemporary view of what is was like.  Again the Australian film industry has failed to give this important chapter in Australia';s history the film it deserved. This is film making at its worst with arbitrary cinematography   bad scripting and dialogue   no character development and cliché jungle warfare scenes.  It fails to imbue the audience in any meaningful perspective other than the Japanese Army were ruthless and cruel murderers of an ill-equipped and badly trained group of Australians fighting in a jungle.  The film failed as most Australian films do to attract a significant Australian audience in fact they stayed away in droves.  I am not going to join the usual parochial garbage of saying its great because its an Australian film. I say either do a great job or just leave it to some one who knows how. This government funded film is just another failure by Australia's wealthy and spoilt rich kids.

      "Just when you think that you've seen the worst the zombie sub-genre can offer  along comes another budding Romero and his team of no-talent mates to prove you wrong.  I've suffered the Zombie Bloodbath trilogy  endured Death Valley: The Revenge of Bloody Bill  sat semi-comatose through The Zombie Diaries  and laughed hysterically during Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence  and genuinely thought that amateur movie-making could sink no lower. However  having just watched Zombie Planet  a two hour long festering pile of drivel from writer/director George Bonilla  I think I have found the ultimate in awful zombie movies.  In this dreadfully amateurish effort  which is part Mad Max and part Dawn of the Dead (but ALL bad)  Frank Farhat stars as T. K. Kane  a tough fighter who kicks zombie ass for a hobby  armed only with knives  a machete  some concussion grenades  and what he obviously perceives to be a really mean glare.  After a desperately unexciting opening sequence in which he takes on a horde of dodgy looking zombies  Kane teams up with a group of survivors who not only have to fend off attacks from the undead  but must also must placate a gang of vicious thugs who have taken control of the area (by searching for and handing over any valuables that they find).  Of course  Kane isn't the type of man to take orders from a bunch of z-grade post-apocalyptic bully boys  and he sets about teaching the bad guys a lesson (mostly by glowering at them in a threatening manner)  only pausing to periodically rescue pals from zombies.  Featuring awful acting from almost everyone involved  a dreadful script  laughable effects  and shoddy production values  there is virtually nothing in this film to make it worth a watch. To be fair  I quite like the basic premise that the zombies are the unexpected result of a highly popular slimming drug that blocks cravings for carbohydrates (we learn this when one character conveniently explains the back-story to Kane  who strangely has no idea what has happened)  but this is about the only vaguely interesting aspect of the whole production.  I have a certain amount of respect for anyone who manages to fund and make their own movie  but when the results are this poor  that respect is lost when they decide to make it available for public viewing. I would've kept this one under wraps if I had made it.\n",

A bloody neck on a scene  a clean neck on the following.  The story could have been improved. Yeah I mean what the hell is the story?   Martial arts? Where? Is that martial arts? Watch how hesitant and slow are the moves!!!!! If giving a kick and receiving a punch is called martial arts  then I am Bruce Lee!!!!  The only good point I have found is on fight scenes : They don't play with zoom and fast switching scenes that gives you headache in most of action movies.  There are plenty of low budget movies that are great. That one was just to make money. Nothing else.\n",

      "The subject matter was good  direction was OK. Mohanlal was efficient in his role as a Major. The acting of the supporting actors was amateurish at best. The casting director and director should be held responsible for this debacle. Hawaldar Jai was terrible  he stood out like a sore thumb with his poor histrionics. He did not look the part nor did he move like a soldier. There was a scene where a satellite feed was required of the skirmish with the militants and they were showing it from a camera angle. Satellite is located hundred of miles in the sky so the only angle is from above.It was quite an embarrassing moment. Audience these days are matured and they recognize when one is trying to pull wool over their eyes. The Director is a Major so the story could be out of his personal experiences. No problem there  but the movie is only as good as its actors and Director. So if Major Ravi is going for any other projects he should pay more attention to the casting.\n",

      "As a CA resident  I'd like to see the jackholes who were shutting down the electricity plants to raise the prices get some jail time too.   I thought the movie was pretty good and has some very informative pieces. While they stuck to how Enron rose and crashed  I found it really interesting. However  when the movie focused on it's anti-Bush slant  it made me wonder if they were really being accurate.   It's fine to point out any connection the Republicans had to Enron  but the monster was created while Clinton was president. The CA energy crisis happened under Davis's watch. Both were in office during Enron's abuses  but neither are held accountable in any way. Rather  many minutes are spent on how Bush was friends with Lay. So what? Lay played golf with Clinton and spent the night in the Lincoln bedroom. Why are Democrats given such a free pass in this film? I think most politicians are a waste of our taxpayer money so I'm not partial to either party but I hate feeling like I'm subject to someone's political agenda when I watch a documentary. Yes  politicians deserve some blame  but I really doubt that the only guilty one's have Rs after their names. I found no value in portraying the Bush's as Kay-lovers when Democrats received just as much Enron campaign money as Republicans did. Like I said  it weakens the rest of the film for me because it makes me suspicious of the rest of the facts they lay out.\n",

      "In a sense  this movie did not even compare to the novel. However  it was good to have a visual of what the Congo looked like and also the natives if you are not good at visualizing as you read. I would never recommend watching the movie rather than reading the book. I hardly suggest even watching this film  let alone any other films based on this literary work. This movie; and many others  did not fulfill this book. One important part that is missing from the movie is MArlow's sense of how government of lack of there in Africa was forming an early genocide. Also in the movie  MArlow and his companions didn't stop and get the note and wood. Likewise  Kurtz' African mistress knocks Marlow out towards the end of the story which has a major influence in the story but was not in the book. In the novel  Kurtz died on the ship  however he died in his hut in the movie. The fiancé's reaction to Marlow's interpretation of Kurtz' last words also differed. This movie is only effective if you wish to visualize more clearly the novel.\n",

      "Quintet marks the only venture of both Paul Newman and director Robert Altman into the realm of science fiction. It was said of Newman that he could not do comedy  but he tried until he finally scored a real success in that genre with Slap Shot. But the failure of this film left him gun shy and he never tried it again.  This is one of the biggest downer films I've ever seen. It's a futuristic ice age  brought on by who knows what  but presumably it's a nuclear winter. Even during the ice age of thousands of years ago  the equatorial parts of the earth still sustained animal and human life  but apparently not here. Seals have survived and Paul Newman is a seal hunter on the outside.  But hunters do need a little R&R and Newman goes to a futuristic city where things are so boring the natives have some kind of game played with six people and it's a kind of Russian roulette. To win you have to kill five other participants in your game.  It's a sad turn to see what man has come down to. Which is one of the reasons I just could not get into this story. The atmosphere is bleak  the story is bleak  the people are bleak  it's all so bleak. No wonder this thing came up short at the box office.  It's a film that just about everyone thinks is never going to be on the top ten list of Paul Newman films  including me.  This is man's future  what a bummer.\n",

To interest  a more threatening menace would have been needed  at least a few people you care for and evokes some emotions in you. And  not the least  something interesting must happen. Something unexpected. As it is  this film just drags on and on  in what seems like forever. Maybe a Saint Bernhard was not that smart to choose as the Terrible Threat to life and society?  In most scary movies/thrillers/mystery  just whatever genre  there must be characters that sparks interest and makes you want to know what happens.

      "After I couldn't ignore the hype about the show  I started watching season one and it struck me as really good and I was hooked.... for about 5 episodes  then it started to spiral downwards. Why? First  Ethan Suplee is scripted to act as a complete idiot confirming that very obviously by spewing out semi-random stuff in great expectations of it somehow becoming the next best joke.  Jaime Pressly's got stunning looks  but if she thinks stretching lips to explore parts of the face to which they normally never go to and making strange grimaces to accentuate everything she says is hilarious  she's way off track. Maybe she thought her character would be too flat  faded and she wanted to make it colorful and spicy  but made a flood of colors  overkill of spices and screams out loud for attention and it hurts my eyes  ears and intellect.  I really  really wanted to love this show  like I said  the premise is great  (comes from the same shelf as The Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain) and Jason Lee is doing a pretty good job here  along with some of the other actors but there is no way no how I would get 'sucked in' and forget that this is just a show  because Pressly's and Suplee's surreal  extreme characters abruptly wake me when they show up. It's worth to note that their characters and acting would be fine if this wasn't a 70 something-part series and if they didn't get that much screen time.\n",

      "I rented this movie  after hearing Chris Gore saying something to the effect of five stars! on that Attack of the Show show. Well when I turned around the DVD and it showed the 3 stages of hell  well I had to buy it. Just to see the spectacle of a mother yelling at her son to drop her other son into a flaming pit.  I wasn't expecting ECW or CZW for an hour and eighteen minutes  but I was expecting at least a summarized version of what seemed to be the main highlight of this movie. Well sadly there wasn't anything like that. The 3 stages of death part happens right from the beginning  and its pretty much downhill from there. Nothing really happens in this documentary. It was pretty raw  bare and unbiased. Not a bad thing  but there is a narrator in this one. You'd expect him to have opinions on the subject of this documentary  but he doesn't. Which would of been nice to have  a message or reason for this doc.There was no real reason to have a narrator  there should of been just text explaining some of the less obvious scenes.  It doesn't really explain the lives of these wrestlers either. It shows a few moments of some dramatic scenes  which sound interesting  but the reality isn't as great as it sounds. For instance mom watching her son wrestle with light bulbs and tacks  for the first time  at a public park. instead of seeing her reaction to the wrestling  They show her reacting to the camera  instead of say a interview later on  or just actually witnessing her reactions.  Legitamit document wise  this one ain't. The source material was flimsy to begin with. Nothing truly profound or interesting really happens. No conclusion to a few of the more interesting stories  No real point or final thought to backyard wrestling  edited together badly  and its and its basically a cheap  failed rip off of Beyond the Mat.  Wrestling wise  this is pretty boring. the better bumps are at the beginning  and slowly become less amazing and shocking. If you have seen Japanese wrestling  Indie wrestling  or even Backyard Wrestling Dvds  than this wont shock and awe you. If you want wrestling don't make the same mistake I did and see this one. Go get some CZW ECW or XPW Dvds instead.  The only thing I got out of this documentary was how stupid people can be. Not for supporting self mutilation or doing dangerous stunts  but their reasoning for committing these acts. The backyarders seem stupid for wrestling. Most of them are jobless  and probably have a few issues in their head  and wrestling is a type of therapy for them. Than the supporters seem even more idiotic. Mothers basically take the whole if ya cant beat em join em reasoning to cope with the fact that their sons are basically killing themselves. School authority figures support their students in their dangerous stunts because its an alternative to joining gangs and to a lesser extend doing drugs  which is kinda funny since that segment took place in a rural town  where like people live 20 miles from one another. People are stupid. Thats what I extracted from this documentary.  If you want to see the reasoning and thoughts to someone brutalizing themselves in wrestling and basically what the back of this DVD promises  get UNSCARRED: the Life of Nick Mondo. Its more amazing  and interesting than the Backyard  and a lot more entertaining. Oh and its actually good.\n",

Some examples:  1) The bleed-through on Charlie Falon's (Sam Elliott) bandage was shown to be coming from the back of his hand while it was his knuckles that were bleeding.  2) Would a detective dispose of his murder victim from a very well-lighted area?

I saw this movie and after end of couple of hours was left scratching my head  what exactly is director trying to say.  If its a thriller  there are no thrills  if its action  there is no action barring a chase sequence  there is no Drama  and the much touted love story  it actually never takes off. No passion  emotion nothing is there.  Actually I never expected wonders from the movie  however after the bumper opening it took  I thought of giving it a chance. I have no problems with Himesh Reshamiya whatsoever  and I am not one of the guys who will bash him at every given opportunity. I went in with an Open mind and came out with a closed one.  Let's not put the blame of Himesh Reshamiya  he is just a Debutant Actor. But direction  screenplay  writing  makeup  everything has gone for a toss.  Himesh is very stiff and would take a lot of time to come up the curve. He can do the don kind of roles. Hansika is just a kid  and it shows on screen with her baby fat and the way she walks.  The only actor who was good was the friend of Himesh in the movie  I don't know his name  but he looks promising.  Watch it at your own risk  not even good to watch it for a time pass viewing.  ** Strongly recommend to avoid this Movie.**\n",

      "This movie might be o.k. if not for all the language in it. I think that the storyline itself isn't bad  but I would be too embarrassed to let my wife or kids see the movie. I know that kids will learn all the swear words along the way eventually  that's true  but parents should not assist them in the process by letting them see and hear the stuff in the guise of entertainment.  I used to quite like Robert Loggia; he has a distinctive gritty quality with that rough voice of his  but in the last few years all I have seen him do are roles with a lot of language in them. If we had an award for over-use of the F word  he would have to be a contender. Unfortunately  I think he's now lost me as a fan. When I see his name on movies in future  I will be thinking twice about picking up that title.  Look  I'm no prude. I use language sometimes too  in extreme circumstances  but when we're watching a movie it is for the sake of E N T E R T A I N M E N T  something which we hope will bring us some joy and escapism.

I like Matt Modine too  but it's a pity that he has associated himself with a picture which has let his image down like this. He probably did an o.k. job in the movie  but I turned off about 1/4 of the way through after having had my ears assaulted once too often by others in the cast. Why can't these actors just say no when these scripts ask them to carry on with this gutter language? Once enough actors  (especially the big names)  kick up a fuss about it  the writers will stop putting it in the movies!  I'm sorry  but I cannot recommend this picture.

I think the characters are still interesting  although sometimes they spin into the white trash things a little too much. Subtlety and nuance goes a long way on shows like Office. I would think the target audience is somewhat similar being they are both on the same night and lineup. One would think that Karma and the whole eastern religion thing is a big enough topic to bring some different and interesting shows  but they only scratch the surface of the subject. In my opinion it shows the contempt that many people have in Hollywood about the level of intelligence of the masses. We can handle more heady content.

      "I bought the DVD to get Julia Ormond. Well  I got that in spades. She was lovely in the romantic scenes; too bad Bill Paxton was flying on autopilot for the whole effort. I almost lost my lunch when he popped his big fat white behind out of his flight suit to shall we say 'engage' with Julia.  I realized Julia was very proficient in French while watching her in 'Sabrina'. I watched 'Sabrina' with the French soundtrack to see if Julia dubbed her own dialog. They used someone else. In any case  Julia was chosen for this Dutch film over a native French speaker with sufficient English to communicate with the American flier. Perhaps they wanted at least one familiar name for the British/American market. To my unfamiliar eye  Julia's features could pass for Belgian.  The whole film had an odd nature. It was a Dutch film about Belgium in World War 2. I would imagine that national pride would have required a theme of heroic Dutch resistance to the German invaders. The Belgians were much more passive during the occupation period than were the French or Norwegians. The most savage fighting of all came in the Balkans where Tito's communist partisans gave the Germans fits.  I noted in another review that 'dbdumonteil' believed Julia Ormond to be an American instead of the actual British nationality. Perhaps Julia's acting skills were great enough to carry off that impression.  After watching this film several times  it suddenly dawned on me how out of season  the film is. It is set on Junuary 16  1944 when the American plane crashes in Belgian farm country. The trees look to be in mid-Fall with lots of leaves and the weather is warm. People walk about in light clothing and the grass is still green. There is not the smallest trace of snow or ice. This must have been the mildest winter in Belgium ever.  The actual plot of the film was a mess. Where to begin? For anyone interested in World War 2 history  the film came across as farce. The reconnaissance plane used was a huge 4-engine converted bomber. Such aircraft did exist  but they would have required massive fighter escort to have any chance of survival. In reality  smaller and swifter aircraft were readily available and would have been far more suitable for the task. The vital code books in the film would never have been carried on the plane. The crew had no need of this information to complete their mission  while compromise of this information would have been a huge intelligence defeat. Even given the premise of the film  the first items to be stripped from the aircraft would be the code books. They would have been on their way to Berlin within 10 minutes of the arrival of German troops at the crash site.  The Daussois home  where 'Major Brice' took refuge was a farm where no one had the least interest in farming. Food would have been very scarce in Belgium at this time. The Germans would have required substantial quantities of locally-produced food to support their forces. The family truck would have been expropriated long before the arrival of the American flier. There would not have been any fuel available to run it anyway.  The plot twist where Henri Daussois turns in the American out of jealousy is pathetic. He would have had to reveal all he knew about the resistance in order to be allowed to live. He would have had to function as a double agent to frustrate any effective opposition. The woman with the secret radio would have never survived the war.  'Major Brice' was caught in civilian clothing toward the end of the film. That made him a spy under the laws of war and liable for execution with no defense. He would not have meekly surrendered to face interrogation unhindered by the Geneva Convention. Better to force them to kill him and spare his friends if possible.  I have not read the novel upon which this film is based. If this film is a faithful adaption  it shows an abysmal lack of development in the novel. Regardless of the novel  the screenwriters could easily have produced a superior script that would not waste this opportunity to deliver a much better film.\n",

It tries to mix comedy and drama and fails at both. The comedy simply isn't funny and the drama is boring and badly acted. You think a film with three comedy legends--Eddie Murphy  Redd Foxx and Richard Pryor--would be great but it isn't. There's nonstop swearing and the OPENING scene has a young boy shooting a man to death (this is shown as being OK). Also we have the beautiful Della Reese degraded into playing a madam. One of the comedic highlights has a long  unfunny and terribly vicious fight between her and Murphy. A boring  offensive and stupid mess. Not the worst Murphy movie but pretty close.

      "This movie should have been called The Eyes of Alexander  and they should have done away with the Bogart concept altogether. The film started out with a lighthearted approach to Bogart's legacy and some comical moments with his surgery oriented face  but after the first 15-30 minutes it morphs into a more serious thriller  where two palm size sapphires  purportedly laid as eyes into a marble headpiece of Alexander the Great  for him  and seen by him  right before his death. So the gems are of great value not only because of their quality and size  but also because of the tie to the Greatest conquerer the world has ever known. Being an expert on Alexander qualifies me to say that this is wholly and completely a fiction  but it makes for a good movie anyway. So the film winds around some early silliness and stumbles along with all sorts of Alexander allusions in both the foreground and background (which I really liked)  ending with a dated shark attack (you couldn't go to a movie in '79-'80 without some shark showing up to menace the audience). There is a yacht named Euridice (Alexander's father's young wife)  a man named Alexander  Philip  Cleitus?  (it's been about 5 years since I've seen the film  so can't remember all the details)  Olympias  some street names  and many others. It was fun to watch the film just to try to catch all the background details that the director (obviously an Alexanderphile himself) put in. When all is said and done  the eyes are retrieved and the camera pans in on them on a bed as the credits roll by. Kind of a neat ending. What would have been more fun would be if they went the Indiana Jones way and had an action adventure. There were many  many real artifacts that could have been used to make this more interesting  or instance  the hand-annotated (by Aristotle) version of the Iliad that Alexander kept with him all his life  even on his many journeys across Asia (would be of incalculable value if found today). Olivia Hussey (my all time favorite b-movie actress)is killed off way too early  and should have been the main actress throughout  not the girl from the Momma's and the Poppa's...though she was herself easy on the eyes. If you can find this flick  it might be worth checking out for the historical stuff and to see Olivia Hussey in an extremely funny deadpan humor bit early on  but beyond that  I'd pass on it for something more entertaining.

      "After watching the first movie in BCI's new Aztec Mummy Collection  it's difficult to believe how excited I was about the set and how upset I was when the release date was pushed back. I've watched a lot of Mexican horror in recent months. Some great  The Curse of the Crying Woman. Some entertaining despite obvious flaws  Night of the Bloody Apes. And some Cheesy  Pick any Santo movie. One thing that all these movies have in common is that none can be called dull. Well  that's not the case with The Aztec Mummy. It's been awhile since I last watched something so sleep inducing. I wasn't hoping for or expecting a great movie  but at least entertain me! The Aztec Mummy takes every situation that could be interesting and sucks the life out of it through repeated scenes of people doing nothing and then extending those scenes for what fells like an eternity. I guess that's what happens when you make an 80 minute movie with only 30 minutes of material. Padding extraordinaire! For example  for anyone who has seen the movie  what purpose does The Bat have other than to bring a masked wrestler type to the screen and to extend the runtime by 15 or so pointless minutes?   I can only hope that the other two movies in The Collection are more entertaining than this one.\n",

      "A man in blackface lands in a spaceship and meets a girl who lives in some sort of shack with a monkey. He hooks her up with a telephone  and she teaches him how to Charleston. Then they fly off in the spaceship  leaving the monkey behind. Cringe-inducing blackface aside  this short film makes no sense. I think that's the plot  but I'm not sure by a long shot.

The somewhat dreary story is helped greatly by the two main actors and there's a semblance of a character study going on here but the film goes downhill fast when Carrie Snodgress' character buys a monkey. Not one of those cute little monkeys. She buys a real big chimpanzee!!!  This sudden plot device basically kills the movie. It's just not conceivable for a woman like the one Snodgress plays  who has a hard time doing anything because of her domineering father  for her to  out of the blue  buy a chimpanzee.

It may have some long-term significance as a snapshot of 1950s US thinking  but there is little else to commend in the mawkish storyline  wooden acting and grating style. There are some interesting photos of long-gone aircraft  but that was not enough for even this aircraft enthusiast to leave it on the screen for the full length.\n",

      "Based on the Elmore Leonard novel of the same name  Killshot suffers from a lack of focus  direction  and creativity  all elements which the original story likely had  and negative test screenings forced severe edits  (including the complete excising of a character) resulting in a film that feels almost nothing like a Leonard story. Far too many characters populate a storyline too simplistic and straightforward (not a typical trait of the author's work) and the focus continually switches between two hit men who are difficult to like and a troubled couple who don't command our sympathy. While the story itself provides precious few twists and turns  sadly by the end of the film its appeal still remains a mystery.   Washed-up hit-man Armand The Blackbird Degas (Mickey Rourke) follows a strict code during his missions that inadvertently sours his latest assignment. Now on the run from his former employer  he haphazardly joins forces with inept misfit criminal Richie Nix (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) to gain some quick cash by extorting a wealthy realtor. When struggling couple Carmen and Wayne Colson (Diane Lane and Thomas Jane) are privy to the thieves' blundered plot  they are forced into hiding as the crazed killers will stop at nothing to silence the two witnesses.   Killshot proves that being based on an Elmore Leonard novel isn't grounds for immediate success or even a promising adaptation. The characters  situations  and even resolutions in the film are all tired and unoriginal and only very randomly hint at something more. It's not that there wasn't potential  especially when Rourke's black-garbed  calm and collected assassin perfectly executes a hit during the opening scene  purpose and principals are just continually abandoned as each minute ticks away. The style and manner in which each character is introduced is the most intriguing; visually the roles of Bird and even Wayne are fleshed out befittingly  giving immediate interest and depth to personas that typically end in a creative impasse.  The pairing of the cold and calculating Black Bird with the irrational and explosive Richie is an enticing combination (comparisons to Fargo would be extravagantly too kind)  except that each character seems to slowly lose track of the traits that kept them initially interesting. As Richie starts picking up the more experienced killer's habits  Bird loosens his grip on his own methods of murder. Regardless of what he sees in his momentary lighthearted fling with Donna (Rosario Dawson)  it's hard to imagine that his final confrontation with panicky Carmen would provoke a confession of his true nature and subsequent carelessness that drastically affects his outcome. Likely or not  this is Killshot's unfortunate downfall  and little entertainment can be garnered from these characters who steadily lose their originality by continually contradicting the habits that once made them intriguing.   - The Massie Twins\n",

      "Director John Madden  of Shakespeare in Love fame  gives us another pretty bad film in Ethan Frome. The plot centers around a new reverend coming into the town of Starkfield where he learns the story of the local crippled man Ethan Frome's sick wife and one-time romantic tryst with the maid. Adapted by Richard Nelson from Pulitzer Prize-winning author Edith Wharton's novel  this film isn't interesting in the least thanks to an abysmally weak script and poor direction that turns scenes that are supposed to be poignant into laughable schmaltz. Still  there are other aspects apart of the film that work - the cinematography is well done  Rachel Portman contributes a lovely score  and while no one is at their best  Liam Neeson  Joan Allen  Patricia Arquette  and Tate Donovan work well in their roles. But overall  Ethan Frome is only marginally worthwhile and is easily forgotten.\n",

I missed a couple of seasons  but after all of the allegations of stealing material I caught a couple of episodes of the Mind of Mencia at the end of July 07. A bit of a change I see! Carlos is much more into toilet humor and sex jokes than the race observations. In one episode he sort of implied he was in the same league as Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle. I think not. Perhaps Comedy Central will give him one more season  but episodes I saw sounded tired and samey with more words beeped out than the Osbournes.

      "Five Fingers relies heavily on barbaric  shock value Hollywood tactics to elicit apparently a positive movie-going response. This is where this movie fails throughout  primarily because it is too graphic to be taken seriously. I was repulsed and disgusted that Five Fingers was even made  and essentially had to force myself to continue watching it. Torture in and of itself is gruesome. Even the sounds coming from a room where someone is being tortured are gruesome. But obviously the makers of this stinker of a movie felt that was not enough. It had to go way beyond what was needed  and simply and effectively ruined any chances this movie had of making some sort of valid point. For this reason  this movie came across as nothing more than being self-gratifying. Five Fingers also pretty much relegates itself to a B-movie status solely by its indulgence on manipulation of time. In other words we are shown the present and then the past is revealed in snippets. This is a little bit of a twist of the normal Hollywood manipulation of time. Whereas the viewer normally is shown page 95 in a 100 page script as the beginning of the movie  and then the rest of the flick is essentially explaining the ending  Five Fingers is dedicated to flashing back  which gets quite tiring by the end of the movie. Overall  Five Fingers made me feel stupid for watching the whole movie  because torture is obviously obscene  and it certainly was not necessary to resort to graphic mutilation to make this point. I am surprised that Dick Cheney did not make a guest cameo appearance at the end as some sort of torture superhero. This movie is a perfect example of what happens when an important topic falls into the hands of greedy  mindless dolts.\n",

I'm gonna have to disagree with the people who say it is not suitable for children.Yes there are some deaths in the movie but isn't death something that children should at least be exposed to? But i digress. The script is riddled with bad puns and lame jokes...the kind i could expect from most dreamworks movies. The music was soppy the morals forced(and forced without any charm whatsoever.)and the characters would burst into song at totally inappropriate times.The characters were also cold and i really couldn't muster up any form of emotion towards them(bar irritation).

      "The Ballad of the Sad Café worked hard at its image  but when it came down to crunch-time  it was left standing in its own self-created dust.  One cannot image saying this out loud  but if Vanessa Redgrave's Amelia were to fight John Wayne or even Clint Eastwood  my hard-earned dollars would have to go to Redgrave. Her portrayal of Amelia was as close to perfection and consumed with more detailed dedication than most actors are willing to give to any multi-million dollar contracted persona. Redgrave gave Amelia this soulful drawl that was a blend of her own unique voice and a hard-earned woman from the south. To the average viewer  this could be construed as annoying  but as the film progressed it became her  Miss Amelia transforming this stage beauty into a roughneck. It was Redgrave's performance  as well as her interaction with the other characters  that made this film stand tall  but not the tallest. The others following her performance were needed  but not stellar. As we moved past the murky cliché image passed on by every set designer hired for the post-Depression South job  the minor characters felt like poster board. The image was needed to set the scene  but the characters of the town had no other purpose. Take for example Rod Steiger's vision of some old  wild spoken preacher. His scenes alone will make any viewer question the validity of this off-the-beaten-path town. The main two players who surrounded Amelia battled with charm for the admirable top scene-stealing moment  but due to the lacking direction  it just seemed faded. The most absurd of the two (albeit both rank high among the questionable sanity line) is Cork Hubbard who plays Amelia's cousin who shows up randomly one night. His character is never quite defined  he lacks true motive  and his loyalties remain uncertain. He plays no vital role in this film outside of forcing us  the viewers  to question his sanity and honesty. Can you create a character simply by sticking out your tongue  flicking your ears  and punching your chest and head? Finally  there is the other end of the absurd  Keith Carradine. Callow's close-ups of this tormented man build character  but our lack of understanding between him and Amelia causes his purpose to flounder. These were the characters  as cliché Southern as they were  some stood forward and attempted to create an absurdist period piece  and I cannot argue that they failed.  Where Ballad of the Sad Café failed to rise above mediocrity was in the cinematography and narrative. This film was about Amelia  and her need for other souls in her life. The audience's level of comfort with the arrival of her midget cousin was entertaining  one couldn't help but wonder if he was honest or merely a confidence man attempt to leech off a warm heart. Cork Hubbard's character is never quite understood  but we do accept him with brief shots of him and Amelia doing small things together. It is his idea that transforms from a recluse businesswoman to a bona-fide café owner. The problem is that director Callow never quite takes us to that dramatic take level between Cork and Redgrave  is the man crazy or does he represent all of Amelia's family? I needed something from Callow that brought these two out of the David Lynch-esquire relationship that they had. Then our pool gets even deeper with the addition of Carradine as Amelia's love interest. Using the technique of a flashback within a flashback  we see the two wed  but never consummate their love  which Amelia's anger against their love drawing him into the world of madness. Why was Amelia so angry? Why was there no connection between Carradine and Redgrave? Why was this even in the film? With the lack of focus towards these characters's connection  the eventual scenes between the two made no sense  throw in Cork's choice and it just gets completely discombobulated. While there were a few beautiful choreographed scenes that Callow created  the inability to transfer his characters from point A to point B. I lost focus  interest  and my care for the characters plummeted when I didn't understand the ultimate question  why?   Overall  The Ballad of the Sad Café began with a bang  but ended with a very small crack of a firecracker. My emotional feel of this film swung up and down  up and down  and eventually stayed further down mainly due to the lack of understanding of the motives of the characters. Redgrave did a phenomenal job as Amelia  and while the other characters (outside of the random Steiger) tried their best  I just didn't quite understand who they were. Their motives were so muddled that when the emotional ending finally occurred  I was apathetic. Director Callow seemed to have been lacking importing connecting scenes that would allow us to understand the dynamic relationship between all of our main players. Callow created some beautiful scenes where faces seemed to overlap the scenery  which allowed us to focus on Amelia  or Carradine  but nothing was explained or developed. The film played out with anger  discover  happiness  flashback  anger  anger  anger  fade out. Without the comparative connectors  this transformed from distinguished period film to actors playing parts in front of camera. It was a shame  because Sad Café had the promise  it just couldn't deliver.  Grade: ** ½ out of *****\n",

      "This is one odd film. It seems to be aimed at a younger audience  but is filled with sexual innuendos. The whole premise is rather absurd  not just the idea of some shrunken heads of three dead kids doing some crime fighting  but the same said kids taking on a gang of tough older guys is a little far-fetched  but then again  the parents are mainly absent in the film and there is a lack of authority figures to keep the kids in line.  The cast are good though  Meg Foster plays a very butch mafia-like leader  with the handsome A.J. Damato as the leader of the bullies. Aerky Egan and Rebecca Herbst are well cast as the young lovers  though for a comic actress of her talent  Leigh Allyn Baker is notoriously wasted in this film.

I went to the video store.. and it was dumb move.. (you'll know why !).. and waw.. I found a lot of Bruce Lee movies.. I selected one named (Bruce Lee in New Guinea)   I did it to myself and watched that one.. OH GOD please forgive your servant.. I harmed myself but with no intended decision.. I wouldn't do it if I knew its evil damaging !! its mythical level of hideousness !!   After that I didn't understand at all what's the big fuss about Bruce Lee as a great immortal star ???.. why anybody would care whether he is here or there.. this hero (whom I've watched !) is not that gifted and not that genius and of course is not that sexy ???   Until my father saw THIS star and he asked me to pause at any of his close ups and after he examined his face a little.. he told me in a very definitive way this is not Bruce Lee ! so I became too confused to ask : who's this silly guy anyway ??!!   It was 2001.. 2 years after my first entry to the IMDb database.. therefore I tended to it immediately to know who the hell is that man.. and I discovered the truth.. he isn't Bruce Lee.. No my dear friends.. he is Bruce Li !!!   And what a huge.. so huge difference !! I just want to know who can love that bad clone ?? Or god forbid .. love his repulsive movies.. I watched 2 of them and couldn't bear finishing the third !

      "I first heard of this film when Patton Oswalt talked about it on his Werewolves and Lollipops CD. He said it was a lost classic that is completely ridiculous. Being a lover of terrible cinema  I knew I was in for a treat.  This film is  hands down  one of the weirdest I've ever seen. Certainly one of the weirdest shlock films. Basically  a demon took human form years ago for a woman  the woman died or something  the demon cried blood  the blood fell on the bed  the bed is now possessed and it now eats. Along with fruit  flowers and chicken  it also has a taste for people. The people can range between horny teens  mayors  gangsters  servants or professional orgy throwers. There's also a sick guy who the bed ate but put his soul behind a picture in the room.  Most movies let you figure out the plot through exciting action. Death Bed takes another path: it basically tells you through narration exactly what's happening while slow  dull murder scenes take place. Also  I must say everyone who's eaten by the bed are surprisingly quiet. I would think if a bed is eating you through the ways of a 5th grade science fair experiment  it would sting a little. I guess nerve endings weren't invented until 1981 or so.  The story is wacky  the direction is slow and pretty awful  the sets are sparse  the acting it fairly painful and the brother is one of the unintentionally ugliest actors I've ever seen. Probably would make a great party film if alcohol and smart-asses are involved. Certainly one you shouldn't miss.\n",

I had to go back to Blockbuster to figure out why on earth I had rented it  which was due to an admittedly amateurish gullibility regarding the cover blurbs  which seemed to imply a seditious John Waters-style humor-fest with a sexual theme. Okay  I laughed a couple of times and it definitely has a sexual theme (although most of it can't be described as stimulating in any way). But  on some movies you might rewind to make sure you heard the dialog correctly--on this one  you fast-forward because you already know what they're about to say.

Obviously  this isn't meant to scare  but one fatal flaw with the production entirely sapped the joy out of the viewing experience. The sound editing was horrible. I had to work the volume control the entire movie. You can imagine how difficult it is to get into something - even a low-budget spoof - when you're either turning the volume up or down  or trying to anticipate the next time you have to do so. The regular dialogue is very low  and all screams  noises  etc.  are VERY loud. We're not talking about toggling between 5 and 7 on the volume control  finding a happy medium at 6. We're talking toggling between 2 and 9 on the volume where it is virtually impossible to leave the volume alone.

He is joined by another and they skate around together creating art. Then comes the unnecessary gay love scene. Then comes the dispute between them that is never actually discussed because this film has about as much dialogue as a charlie chaplin picture. This movie does show the gravity street artists give to their form well  and the music is nice  but overall I wouldn't really call it a film.\n",

      "This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  What is the purpose of this movie? A bunch of Americans enters Nazi-occupied France and starts slaughtering Germans. You see them scalping their enemies and beating them to death with baseball bats. While making jokes  of course.  Some will say that this movie is a parody of a certain genre. For a parody  it is neither witty nor funny. The contents is zero. It is exceptionally brutal and disgusting. Underneath lies a subtle political message  because it is again the good guys killing bad Nazis. The whole plot is unthinkable if you turn it around. Could you imagine a storyline where Nazis (while making jokes) kill everybody in the Warsaw ghetto with flamethrowers? Probably not  but this movie is exactly about that  with the exception that is satisfies the weird moral expectations of a certain audience: slaughtering people is so cool when done by the right people.  This movie only works because of the hidden Nazi-ideology underneath. It does not regard the enemy as people. And if the latter is supposed to be an element of the fun  I am happy to say that this kind of fun will always remain a mystery to me.  Another mystery is how such violence can fascinate the American crowd while a bit of nudity will freak them out. But if a naked body is pornography  this movie with all its brutality is pure pornography at its very worst.  Inglorious Basterds is a pointless  boring and tasteless waste of time and money.\n",

      "This film is about the worst I have seen in a very long time. Terence Stamp's talent is totally wasted and just about the only thing that I enjoyed was hearing a favorite song of mine  If I Had a Million Dollars by BNL  in the opening credits.  Ashton Kutcher plays the main character  a nice guy who gets roped into house sitting for his boss. Misadventures ensue. Blah blah blah. If you have time to kill and having nothing better to do  then this is the movie for you. Otherwise  watch something else.  There are not necessarily any redeeming moments  but it is nice to see Molly Shannon and Jeffrey Tambor on the screen. They are always pleasures to watch though this film managed to dampen even these bright spots.\n",

      "I hate guns and have never murdered anyone  but when even half of the events that take place in 'Shuttle' happen to you or close ones and you find a gun  YOU SHOOT YOUR ATTACKER. THREE TIMES. FIVE TIMES. Whatever makes the pulse stop on them and increase on you. I think even God would say  Good call. In a very 'Hostel'-type film  but more realistic  as this really could happen to anyone  well  if you're a pretty young woman  that is  'Shuttle' was a decent film  though on the long side. A few good shocks (always call AAA even just to change a tire)  basically just one surprise but for the most part  you could see things coming. And aside from the typical tie him up instead of the previously mentioned shooting him  the most annoying part was the revelation towards the closing from one best friend to the other. Getting past those  it's enjoyable for what it is. Basically  we have two unsuspecting females traveling alone from Mexico home (wow  that's original) and one lost her luggage preventing them from leaving the airport until late. And after an obvious foreshadowed sign-language scene  they enter a too-good-to-be-true half-price shuttle ride. Clichéd jocks  previously introduced  con their way on the shuttle  to join what appears to be Alan Ruck's stunt double from 'Speed.' From here  it's obvious what happens (I did mention it was a 'Hostel' knock off) but still  I didn't find too much horrible  yet nothing spectacular. Though  it would've served the audience better with roughly 15-20 minutes deleted  I would recommend if you have almost 2 hours to kill and are into sick horror.\n",

Just one example: Morgan preyed on the few ethnic Chinese he encountered. The acting is over the top  the script is a poorly written lie. I have never seen worse fake beards.  Hopper arrived in Australia and reportedly only would make the film if the script was totally rewritten so he could be a hero. Since the script was ten made up on the fly  the may explain how bad it is and how disjointed the movie is.  Any movie about Ned Kelly is a lot better than this film.\n",

      "A tedious mixture of puerile efforts at humour with romantic relationship melodrama fails to provide this weakly made film with any flavour of reality. As action opens  Reno (A.J. Buckley) enters his apartment  there discovering his girlfriend in flagrante delicto with his roommate  who gloatingly tells Reno Well  at least it's with someone you know  resulting in Reno's decision to never have another roommate  this decision told to viewers by means of a soon abandoned voice-over. The storyline then proceeds ten months where we find that Reno is indeed true to his word concerning avoidance of roommates  although this appears to beg the question due to his garnering of a live-in lover  Holly (Holly Fields)  with whom he has generated marital plans. The plot briefly shifts to a sleazy Hollywood strip club  wherein Reno's Uncle Charley  enamoured of a dancer whom he finds eminently desirable  keels over dead atop the club's bar after seeing the unadorned charms displayed by the object of his affections. It is apparent that Charley had been aware of the flawed condition of his heart  because he created a video tape during which his commentary bequeaths his large (and mortgaged) residence in Hollywood to Reno  and we see the latter deciding to  contrary to his vow  interview applicants for two roommates as tenants  with he and Holly sharing the selection process in an organized manner. Following an inane sequence involving bizarre renter candidates  all of whom Reno and Holly unsurprisingly find unsuitable for living along with them in their house they  unknown to each other  each select a renter of the opposite sex  with the lovers manifestly cool toward the choice of their partner. The newcomers (Chad and Nicole) would seem to have little discernible point to their existence other than highly aural fornication with a broad range of partners  and it is not long before jealousy mars the harmonic relationship of Reno and Holly. Reno is bent upon patenting and merchandising a type of sporting travel bag and  as he has given an engagement ring to Holly  the potential success of this entrepreneurial adventure is of great financial significance if he intends to advance his marital plan. Unfortunately  the rapacious team of Chad and Nicole  whose every action is ostensibly laced with lust  is likely to disrupt any future wedding intentions of Reno. Direction is slack  plainly far from fulfilling basic needs of the players  although an erratically composed script provides scant material with which actors may work  and ad libbing falls embarrassingly flat. As a result  the performances are undistinguished  not aided by spotty editing  while the manner of camera-work changes as abruptly and often as a firefly's tail light. Filmed with a low budget and on location  only a modicum of skill is required for the designing processes  but a larger measure of value might have been placed upon the tasteless D.J. background soundtrack  generally blaring and nearly always invasive. A good deal of discussion has been stimulated by the movie's final sequences that are apparently not expected by a viewer based upon what has come before  but in reality these comprise probably the only thoughtful portions of a poorly cobbled screenplay  and bids fair to make the work almost watchable  despite the shabby quality of the production as a whole.\n",

      "Quentin Tarantino once said that to succeed in the film industry you had to make your own Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs. Writer/actor/director Larry Bishop seems to have taken that advice a little too literally with Hell Ride and concocted a messy homage that borrows much too heavily in its visuals  music  camera-work  and time-altering storytelling. But to properly mimic a Tarantino film  one has to have a knack for constructing creative conversations; unfortunately Hell Ride's primary derailing element is its atrocious ramblings and vulgar monologues that only work to disgust and confuse the audience while simultaneously invoking pity for the actors just for being involved.  The anti-hero protagonist biker gang  The Victors  consists of several weathered vigilantes who bring their own brand of bloodthirsty justice to the lawless roads. The leader  Pistolero (Larry Bishop)  is hell-bent on revenge and putting out fires. The Gent (Michael Madsen) just tries to balance his chaotic  psychotic symphony of life with putting lead into anyone who crosses his boss  and Comanche (Eric Balfour) follows with a fierce loyalty and a mysterious past.  On the villainous front  Deuce (David Carradine) is the mastermind who orchestrates from afar  though not quite far enough  and Billy Wings (Vinnie Jones) spits venom and lewd explanations for his tattoos while toting a harpoon gun and a general disdain for life. While these characters might sound interesting on paper  once they're forced to rant horrendously ill-conceived dialogue all traces of cool disappear faster than the funding should for Bishop's next film.  While Hell Ride is riddled with imperfections and missed opportunities  the main facet of its undoing lies in the poorly devised conversations. And because Bishop's main influences are the talky films of Tarantino  there are a lot of them. The first twenty minutes of the movie are nearly unintelligible and would probably make as much sense muted. By the time Pistolero's main squeeze is introduced and certain phrases are overused to the point of nausea  you'll pray for both death and the ability to turn the sound off. Even Dennis Hopper has trouble remaining cool while spouting off such goofy dialogue.  Have you ever repeated a word or phrase to yourself so many times that it just doesn't sound right or even make sense anymore? Bishop starts there and then keeps the madness going until you envy the characters on screen getting their heads cut off. And when the dialogue finally takes a break  we're treated to interspersed shots of nude female oil wrestling and throats being slashed. I'm not sure what effect Bishop hoped to attain  but I doubt he found it.  Hell Ride wants to pay homage to Quentin Tarantino films  Robert Rodriguez films  and every movie that idolizes the violent and devil-may-care attitudes of bikers. But while its intentions may be noble  the horrendously cringe-worthy dialogue and the hyper-stylized timeline-mangling editing prevents the audience from becoming invested with the generic tough-guy characters. By the time we figure out the mystery behind the characters' motives (and it may be awhile before you even realize there's a mystery to be solved)  it's just too hard to care anymore. And while everyone on screen is clearly having fun  they've entirely neglected to translate any of that entertainment to the audience.  - Joel Massie\n",

      "This is fairly typical for the Sci-Fi Channel: one-dimensional characters  a ridiculous plot  and terrible special effects. We've got some alien sock puppets loose on a train  and Lou Diamond Phillips does his best with what little he's given to eke out a performance. And save the day. Everyone else in this is utterly dispensable; the ex-wife who goes through the time-honored cliché of first disliking Lou  then of course comes to love him again at the end. The obnoxious State Senator who gets munched early on  and a gaggle of dull security guards who run around a lot. Then there's an eco-terrorist who is in this movie for absolutely no reason whatsoever  except to provide us with 3% more running around. He spends the whole middle part of the movie hiding in a box.  The special effects really deserve their own paragraph. We start with a meteorite that flies through the air  trailing flames behind it  at about 100 miles per hour. According to the physics of this movie  if you exceed the posted speed limit in your car  atmospheric friction may cause you to burst into flames. Then it lands on the hood of a car  coming in horizontally. Sort of like a velcro ball landing on a velcro floor I guess. It really doesn't damage the car much  just bends up the hood a little bit. Later on Lou gets in a helicopter and goes chasing after the train. Even though the train only had a two minute head start  it takes a good half hour to catch it. The CGI is so bad that the helicopter looks like it's as big as the hills it's flying over. Then it flies into the side of a mountain - this effect must be seen to be believed. It looks like they took a jar of gasoline and threw it against a wall  then superimposed the flame effect over the helicopter. About 10 times too big. No wonder the helicopter couldn't pull up in time  it was carrying five tons of nitro glycerine. Then the eco-terrorist eventually blows himself up  but instead of exploding in all directions like most explosions do  he explodes upwards like a cannon aimed into the air. Then there's the whole deal with not being able to stop the train because that would allow the little aliens to get off  but it appears that the aliens can actually fly faster than the train is traveling  so why this would keep them on the train I have no idea.  Overall  if you've got a couple of hours that absolutely need killing  and it's down to this movie or reruns on the Food Network  well  come to think of it  some of those chefs are kind of cute. Usually these movies have at least one or two things about them that make it possible to sit through them; maybe there's a sexy girl  some T&A  or a character that actually has some personality  or some suspense or  well  something. I really didn't see any of that here.\n",

The sight of seeing Jim Ross in that terrible gown still gives me nightmares to this day and I'm 21 years old  so you could imagine it when I was 7 years old! Bobby Heenan was funny though.  Matches included The Undertaker vs Giant Gonzales in a p*ss poor match  The Headshrinkers vs The Steiner Brothers in a useless match  Doink vs Crush in a comedy match and a boring match featuring Razor Ramon vs Bob Backlund. Hulk Hogan teamed up with Brutus Beefcake to battle Money Inc. You could clearly see Hogan had a black eye. In storyline purposes Ted DiBiase and IRS beat up Hogan while he was playing poker or something like that in the casinos  which is a poor storyline  but in reality  Macho Man Randy Savage hit Hogan because Savage thinks he's like The Hulk (no pun intended) no not the wrestler but the film character.  The main event consisted of Bret 'Hitman' Hart facing off against Yokozuna in a very boring main event match. Mr Fuji threw salt in the face of Hart and Yoko won  but not until Hogan came down and squashed Yoko in 21 seconds.  Overall Grade - E\n",

      "As was mentioned before in other comments  the major problem of NVA is that it cannot decide what it wants to be  slapstick of the cheapest kind or an honest parody of the East German Army. There are a couple of moments which are quite moving  for example when one of the recruits returns from the army prison in Schwedt with a completely broken personality. But in the end  Leander Haußmann goes for the infantile humour. No wonder the film flopped at the German box office as it's historically untruthful to the real situation in those training camps and led by an actor who is unfortunately incapable of giving a nuanced performance.

They had a nice attitude in the movie jackass so i figured i'd tune in on viva la Bam. Boy was i mistaken. Seriously  you could pair a bunch of 2'graders  provide them with the same budget and i bet they could knock off something more creative on the screen. I mean  C'Mon MTV!! At 23 where most people are tuned in you give us this rubbish.  Everything seems so forced. You don't know the characters because there's no attitude at all. You can't appreciate Bam or Dunn  or anyone for that matter. If there would just be a tiny tiny doze of thought. Anything we won't forget as soon as next shot goes on.

      "I wasn't expecting much from this film  but was eager to try something which I initially thought would primarily be an early 80s teen horror. Although three teens are somewhat critical plot  it is by no means a teen horror film.  'The Power' is about a little Aztec idol that exchanges many hands as its possessor (who must be adult and thus  'corrupted') becomes the vessel for unleashing all of the idol's evil  and often with deadly implications for not only the victims of the possessor  but of the possessor himself. After making several exchanges in vying over control of this thing  three teenagers wind up finding it and can't figure out what it is  except that since they found it  strange and dangerous things are afoot. They offer to explain the situation to a news reporter who doesn't buy into the spiritual bologna. Although  it is her producer who wants to investigate further  especially if it means he can get control of the idol (I presume the teens are even not yet corrupted enough to feel the dangerous desires encouraged by the idol). It is a story told a thousand times  particularly in 1950s and 60s horror and science fiction fare.  This one was at least  for me  able to sustain some interest. Though low budget  it was not done so obviously cheaply or loaded with bad acting as many of the low-budget  come-and-go horror fare of the earlier decades had (nowadays  they have the same cheesy qualities  but bigger budgets). We are spare enough of it to at least allow ourselves an opportunity to become at least a little bit absorbed with the eerie atmosphere and so forth  despite a story of clichés. And  though not terribly gory  the special effects were done nicely.  Again  it is routine horror tale  especially with the ending (which by modern standards has become a device that is annoyingly overused)  but one that is not so embarrassingly bad. It might be worth checking out  even if just for laughs.\n",

      "CAMP BLOOD   Aspect ratio: 1.33:1 (Nu-View 3-D)  Sound format: Mono  Whilst hiking in woodland near the deserted Camp Blackwood - site of an unsolved murder ten years earlier - four young city-dwellers are targeted by a masked psychopath who kills their guide (Courtney Harris) and stalks them through the woods with murderous intent...  Low-rent time-waster  filmed on camcorder utilizing the Nu-View field sequential 3-D format. There's a plot  at least  but the script adheres closely to an established blueprint (with obvious nods to the likes of Friday the 13th  The Burning and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre) without adding anything even remotely new or interesting to the formula. Director Brad Sykes - also responsible for similar 3-D efforts like THE ZOMBIE CHRONICLES (2001) and BLOODY TEASE (2002) - cites the early works of George A. Romero and Sam Raimi as key influences on his career  but while those filmmakers challenged the mainstream with their no-budget efforts  Sykes uses video technology merely to imitate his cinematic heroes  resulting in a home movie with delusions of grandeur. Aside from the 3-D format  there is NOTHING here to warrant anyone's attention. Followed by CAMP BLOOD 2 (2000).\n",

      "There is nothing wrong with showing an old man falling in love with a young girl. Lolita did it. American Beauty did it.  But. They did it subtly. They did not make it so apparent from the start that the director is gearing them up to make them fall in love with each other. Not as naturally as two people would (Age no bar) but forcing them to be around each other as if they were SUPPOSED to fall in love.  All in all  there should have been chemistry. It would have solved the biggest problem. People with reservations against the subject would also have been engrossed and perhaps convinced. It would have become the perfect love story  no matter the impracticality.  I found it difficult to believe Jia's character at times. What I found more difficult to understand  is why Vijay - a photographer and an artist  who seems serious - would have had an interest in a girl so frivolous. Unless he himself has some frivolousness hidden in himself  which did not come out at all.  There is a lot of use of Dutch angles or angles in which the frame is tilted. It is generally used to show something unnatural or something that might lead to something that is not right. So RGV is himself calling the relationship unnatural.  The camera angles  background score  editing  and even the juxtaposition of shots and symbology emphasises and overemphasises their relationship. Is the Indian audience so dumb that we need to be told something in 10 different ways for us to understand? Especially when the two of them were dancing together... it was apparent what was happening. What was the need of slowing the scene down with dramatic background music? I feel the subject was very well chosen. But Verma should not have made the film with the fact in mind constantly that this is a controversial subject.

Kidman portrays her as wan and vague  whereas she was someone who knocked people over with her charisma. The totally fictional relationship that is central to the film is quite unbelievable  and Robert Downey is truly annoying in his smirking portrayal of someone who seems to think he's superior to the rest of the world simply because of his affliction. The film depicts this encounter as being the source of Arbus's interest in freaks  which is a truly banal explanation for the inspiration behind some of the greatest photographs of the 20th century.

      "This is the type of film that makes you question your past admiration for a particular director before you stop and remind yourself that there are very few people whose body of work doesn't contain a few clunkers.  The casting in Lelouch's films is of utmost importance because he puts the viewer into such intimacy with the characters. The actors have to bring real screen magic to live up to the intensity. Otherwise it is just hollow.   None of the actors in this film had any of that screen magic  in my opinion.  Jeremy Irons and Patricia Kaas fell far short as the leads. Irons is a talented actor but he was wrong for this part. Lovable rogue didn't suit his strengths. His brand of charm also hit a false note for me here. Iron's persona is too decadence-tinged to fit into a Lelouch love story.  Although I would hesitate to pass up any opportunity to hear an English accent  I also think an American actor would have worked better in this role. So many of the songs that Kaas sings are so closely identified with the Americanness of the particular lyricist that it seemed kind of discordant to then have Jeremy Irons playing the love interest -- even though logically it really didn't matter. It still screwed up the flow of the movie somehow. At least for me.  Of course  it would have had to have been the right American. I think George Clooney would have been great in the part. And he would have brought the screen magic in spades. Brad Pitt could also have done a really good job delivering his particular combination of charming and edgy.  I was also very disappointed with Patricia Kaas. In reading about her  I've learned that she has a hugely successful career as a singer and many fans  so what do I know  but I found her screen presence as a singer very boring. She was actually a much better actress in her speaking scenes than she was a singer in those scenes in which she had to interpret and sell a song. Nothing she sang moved me. She was pleasant but bland.  In contrast  someone like Kate Hudson  who is not a professional singer and has only voice-coach French still would have handled this part a million times better. Not to mention all that stunning French talent out there that could have been tapped into. It was wrenching watching Patricia Kaas take up screen space when there are so many charismatic French actresses who could have been cast instead.   The music was so important in this film  it could not really work without the music working. And since Kaas delivered so poorly in this respect  the movie never really had a chance.

      "I happened to rent this movie with my sister in hopes of watching a great entertaining movie  that was humorous  however my expectations were let down. This movie was beyond disgusting and revolting for a PG-13 movie  this should have been rated R for the many mature references that went on in this movie. I wouldn't recommend allowing a 13 year old teen see this.  Even if no one under the age of 17 is watching this movie  beware of a truly stupid movie  there's no humor in the movie  just a bunch of disgusting sexual references including a small touch of pedophilia  something that shouldn't even be joked about.   I would like to know what happened to PG-13 movies  that were actually safe for actual a 13 year old? This is beyond a deplorable movie and should be re-rated.\n",

      "A young man  named Danny  has run away from home and meets a drifter  named Bix  who agrees to tag along with Danny and watch out for him... and his money. They end up in a small town where they meet Carrie - a shy  naive girl working in her father's diner. Bix starts seeing Carrie but he plans on leaving soon (because he's a drifter  see? He's no good! Understand?). Meanwhile  the town creep  Jesse (played by a perfectly casted Jack Elam)  keeps showing up at the diner and bothering Carrie. Danny keeps inadvertently picking up whores left and right (because he's loaded with money  he has almost a hundred dollars!) whom Bix has to constantly chase away (there are a lot of ambiguously gay overtones between Danny and Bix in this flick). Eventually  Bix and Danny decide to leave town but trouble is a-brewing  due to Jesse the creep.  My review of the movie itself: a terrible  dated Troubled Youth flick from the '50s.  My review of the MST3K version of the movie: I've got to say that this is one of the best episodes of MST3K ever. The riffing is dead-on  all the time. Except for the somewhat downbeat ending  this movie is easy material for Joel and the Bots  especially Danny's constant screw-ups that Bix has to rescue him from. The host segments are pretty good too  especially the segment with the `Train Song.' Hopefully  Rhino releases this episode to home video one day.\n",

      "In Los Angeles  the alcoholic and lazy Hank Chinaski (Matt Dillon) performs a wide range of non-qualified functions just to get enough money to drink and gamble in horse races. His primary and only objective is writing and having sexy with dirty women.  Factotum is an uninteresting  pointless and extremely boring movie about an irresponsible drunken vagrant that works a couple of days or weeks just to get enough money to buy spirits and gamble  being immediately fired due to his reckless behavior. In accordance with IMDb  this character would be the fictional alter-ego of the author Charles Bukowski  and based on this story  I will certainly never read any of his novels. Honestly  if the viewer likes this theme of alcoholic couples  better off watching the touching and heartbreaking Hector Babenco's Ironweed or Marco Ferreri's Storie di Ordinaria Follia that is based on the life of the same writer. My vote is four.  Title (Brazil): Factotum  Sem Destino (Factotum  Without Destiny)\n",

      "I only voted it 2/10 mainly because Hitchcock agreed to direct it.He certainly had an off-day with predictable plot lines  stupid childish characters who are desperately trying to be funny.There were twee hygenic  sanitised  emasculated sex scenes at a time when the Hollywood Production code was in full force.Lazy male characters in the film who like soap characters never do a stroke of work for which they are paid.It always irritates me when food is usually never eaten by actors (one exception was in the eating scene in Tom Jones (1963); although copious amounts of drink are consumed - actors have to leave their mouths free for the next line! Carole Lombard certainly fitted Hitchcock's cool blond idealised image of a heroine  but what ever possessed him to direct this worthless unfunny script  he should have stuck to his thrillers.It certainly has not worn well over the last 69 years.I couldn't wait for it to end as it gradually irritated me no end.\n",

I can't figure out which is worst; Norris' dull portrayal of anonymity (not a great trait in an action protagonist) or Christopher Neame's hysterical overacting. This film doesn't deliver on any level what so ever. The action sequences are tame  the plot is paper thin  and the scenes that are supposed to be horrific look like a cliché from the fifties. You can't just fill a room with smoke and men in rubber suits  and expect the audience to scream in terror.  Visually the film does nothing for me.

So much so that you don't feel bad for Caines character when his son gets murdered (which was actually mostly due to bad editing). The script was too bland. None of the situations matter as you watch them. The soundtrack  or lack there of (if there was it wasn't good enough to even remember) does not help it one bit. Only good surprise to this movie was Andy Serkis' performance. It was on par if not better than Caine's. The story would have probably gone better off if Serkis would have killed him.

      "This is  for different reasons  a very very bad action movie. First of all  Seagal is terribly out of shape. He looks old and fat  plays like he has to fulfill an annoying obligation and his fight scenes require creative editing or plain replacement. Secondly  his opponent is a very weak villain. This is about a smart and mean masterbrain and Chestnut does not deliver. So what about the action ? Well  the two parties permanently shoot at each other in different locations of the Alcatraz jail. They shoot wild and bad  because compared to the amount of required ammunition  the bodycount is rather low. There is nothing to save this movie. There is not a single good line and not a single good joke. The little psychological interlude with 49er One and judge McPherson is ridiculous. So what does it have? Well  the usual Bell helicopters  silhouettes moving in blue light and slow motion  doors riddled with bullets and 1000 Watt lights shining through the holes  characters jumping through the air while shooting  loads of weapons coming from nowhere  a long black coat containing a bold black guy and a thin wooden box containing 25 tons of gold. The pain continues to the very last take  a hopeless approach to lighten up the closing credits. Californian beachboy Don Michael Paul was writing and directing.

      "I agree in many parts with the fairly thorough review already posted on the subject of the miniseries  and agree that it does have its pros  not only its cons. For example  the original film manage to truncate much of the middle and final sections of the novel into a single montage  including the discovery of Gurney Halleck and the love affair of Paul Atreides and Chani  which  on reading the novel  is a travesty  probably born of the studio cutting shenanigens of which the other reviewer writes. This was one of the great failings of the original film  and the miniseries  to its credit  does include many of the original plot lines that were cut out of the Lynch film due to the expansive nature of the Herbert novel.  However  this in itself is a double edged sword. Rather than complete a text-to-celluloid transfer of the novel  the creators of the miniseries were tempted to create their own plot lines  absent from the original novel. Similarly  although this is surely a fuller account of the storyline of Dune  it is also a break from the originals heart and soul & main vision - that of prophecy. Where are the internal monologues that characterize Herbert's writing and demonstrate what the many different characters are thinking  without the need to suddenly switch viewpoint  or expand in words or unnecessary and stilted spoken monologues? Gone. So much of the original agony of Paul's decision to choose the jihad or death  the choice to fulfill the prophecy or swing away from it  surely the most interesting aspect of the novel itself (and one which captivates people who are far from Science fiction fans) is missing.   Without prophecy  what is the point of Dune? It is simply a more educated and learned version of Farscape or Andromeda. How sad that this is all we are provided with. Lynch's film was flawed  yes. But a flawed film could lead to a correction by another film-maker  taking on some of the best points of Lynch's film-making and rejecting some of the more overblown aspects of the style whilst restoring the storyline. Now this story shall probably never be translated to film again  and this I find heartrending.\n",

      "Yes  absolutely dreadful  And this coming from someone who loves bad movies - but there's a limit. I enjoy all sorts of horror/suspense films  and have seen some wonderful work from European film makers. Broceliande is sadly not among those those wonderful pieces of film-making. The camera work is worse than amateurish. Not the fashionable  shaky MTV cameraman needs Ritalin type of camera work so many film-makers use to camouflage their lack of talent. This is simply bad frame composition and terrible image composition. The acting is farcical when it is not entirely two-dimensional. The dialogues are stilted and unnatural - even more so than your usual run-of-the-mill horror/suspense film delving into pseudo-mysticism. I think that what put me off the most was the horribly choreographed fight scenes at the end of the film. These were bad to the point of being ludicrous. I've seen what a small budget can do  and it can do wonders. This was just bad film-making. Very  very sad.\n",

      "Sure  most of the slasher films of the 1980's were not worth the  celluloid they were filmed on  but this video nightmare may well be  the dullest produced.  Six horny pot smoking students decide to go camping. Of course   and you know this already  they begin getting killed one by one by a  mysterious stranger. The climax has a hunky forest ranger trying to  get to the teens in time before the last cute girl becomes buzzard  bait.  John Carl Buechler  my least favorite B-movie guy  did the lousy  makeup effects here. The cast features Carel Struycken  of The  Witches of Eastwick and the Addams family movies. Sadly  he  does not pop up until the very end of the film  and is covered in  burn makeup  rendering him unrecognizable. Steve Bond (anyone  remember him?) is here in an early role as a victim.  Brown's direction  and the script he cowrote  both smell like the  presents brown bears leave in the woods. He pads the film with  so much stock wilderness footage  I thought I accidentally rented a  special episode of Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom. Much of the  cast sits around the campfire and eats  then walk  and sit and eat  again. The forest ranger is involved in the strangest scene ever put  in a slasher film: he tells a joke about a wide mouthed frog to a  baby deer. Jackie Coogan  who must have forgot he once worked  with the legends of silent cinema  has two scenes  and is involved  in the second strangest scene ever put in a slasher film: he and  the hunky forest ranger have a conversation about cucumber and  cream cheese sandwiches on oatmeal bread...yeah.  There is not one minute of suspense here. The killer  a forest fire  survivor looking for a mate  watches the students from behind  trees. We know it is the killer because the film makers have  dubbed in a heart beat sound effect that helpfully serves to wake  the viewer up every few minutes.

This is rated (R) for physical violence  mild gun violence  gore   some profanity  brief female nudity  mild sexual content  sexual  references  and drug abuse.\n",

The film begins on a good note as there is some suspense created. However as the film progresses what is shown is just a futile attempt at creating something meaningful as Arcand shows us half a dozen oddball whimsical characters whose lives are intertwined with each other.Homosexuality and Lesbianism are not of any consequences here. What is even more bothersome is the feeling of guilt related to the characters who are rather in a fix regarding their feelings towards each other and sexuality.Such a film would be of interest to some who wants to see a different Denys Arcand film.All in all there would surely not be many takers for this film.\n",

But the the third one has no point!! It's supposed to be a sequel that Carry's on from JP2 and yet it magically includes brand new things to the franchise that would have been impossible to miss on the previous 2 films! for example: 1) The new mega Spinosaurus - Seriously  what the hell!!

Its ridiculous!. The star character in the previous 2 movies was  and always will be the T-Rex so what does the d(urr)irector Joe Johnston go and do? Kill it off! as soon as you see the huge T-Rex in all its awesome roaring glory it gets killed and you never see it again - a new Dino on the town is the excuse.. where did it come from!!?? not a single explanation! and don't get me started on the whole satellite-phone-in-the-Dino-belly thing! 2)Just when you start to get over how stupid the Spinosaurus is you see the Raptors  Aside from their new Punk Haircuts they seem pretty credible! *Phew* they will make this movie watchable right?... WRONG! now they speak to each other!! and the excuse for them speaking in this film and not in the First and second are...wait for it...

Its so poorly done  it is really unbearable  even if your just watching it with the intentions of having a no-brain day at home. Where do we start? Well... the sets are pretty drab. My old drama group created more realistic stages. The genetics labs look like they are from a university  and it looks equally unbelievable on the outside (Even for cover-up  why would you place yourself near civilisation where people can easily hear the dinosaur roars)  whilst the doctors ward just doesn't look believable at all. Next up in the complaints list is the creature effects; well  what can I say? Absolutely pitiful. Also  I think it's worth mentioning  the woman's tits should be mentioned as an effect. Both of the main female characters have so obviously had boob-jobs  and it brings the characters down  being one female is a respected member of police  whilst the other is the sweet  innocent daughter of the towns sheriff. The acting  though  is by far the worst tragedy. Eric Roberts can be excused for at least trying a bit to give his role something. Thats where it ends. Corbin Benson should have killed his costume designer for making his lacklustre performance look even more pathetic  whilst the female lead looks SO bored (Though  with this film you could let her off). The other character I'll point out is the daughter  who lets her tits do all the acting in the raunchy sex scene (Ten minutes of endless re-run shots of her bouncing on top of some bloke).

Perhaps she should stick to the more worldly  somewhat corruptive characters that she has generated in other performances.\n",

      "I haven't seen this film in years  but the awful taste of Quaid's performance still lingers on my tongue. Some have commented on how Quaid has Jerry Lee Lewis to a tee but the fact is he only appears to have the most extreme stage Jerry in mind. Nobody acts that way all the time  and the performance comes off as hopelessly clownish  reducing Lewis to a buffoonish caricature. The nuances of a man's life are lost in the rubble of sheer over-acting.  The author of the book this is based on (Nick Tosches) is a good writer  who has written several fine musical bios (I particularly liked Dino on Dean Martin); in the books Tosches gives us a full human being  both separate from and involved in the biz. Quaid's acting seems to imply that Jerry never acted like a human being. If people were like this  no one would bother to hang around them. As cartoons go  it is mildly amusing  but otherwise it is one of the most egregious  film-destroying performances I have had the honor of viewing. Terrible...\n",

      "There is nothing in this that the viewer could point to and call good. The acting was dull and sedated. The sets and cinematography look like they were developed by someone grew up in a Starbucks and tried to make the perfect Gap commercial. Characters have no drive  motivation  or reason for us to care about them. There's such a lack of interest and tension that it's hard to follow the banal action and dialog. And the plot... if anyone finds it  I'm sure it would be as boring as everything else.  This isn't funny  it's not romantic  it doesn't reflect on the human condition. If you want a good stoner comedy  watch Half-Baked; if you want a good stoner drama  watch Trainspotting. The only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of one is because it's kind of fun seeing some familiar faces in the mid-late 90's cast. Which is a shallow reason to give the film even one star  but  then again  this is a shallow movie.\n",

      "Today  being President's Day  my wife and I had The Notebook DVD  checked out at our local library. It's a movie released in 2004 that fell beneath our radar  as we are big movie goers. I'm a published author with hopes of screen playing my first book. I'd noticed references to The Notebook in reviews of other movies which is why I brought it up about us watching and this morning provided the perfect opportunity. We both really liked it. It made my wife cry; we could relate to many things in it with our own  continuing love affair and even I fought back choking up.  This afternoon  after lots of chores  yard work and eating  we decided to actually catch a matinée. When we got to the theater  having seen most of the current batch of films playing  we elected to see Victoria Day which for some reason was not at the theater  even though both IMDb and my phone movies showed it playing there. So  instead we looked at the poster for Dear John and that it was written by the same writer as The Notebook  making it the obvious choice as we enjoyed 'TN' so much.  What a disappointment! First  the characters did not have the same believability or sense of empathy as 'TN'; and we kept commenting throughout all the similarities -- two dozen or so -- quickly causing us to realize this movie was nothing but  as another reviewer commented  a poor man's Notebook! It had a real 'cash cow' feeling  meaning the Sparks simply threw a story together  based on the exact template of 'TN' simply to make a quick buck. Not only that  after the 'bug-eyed' trollop improbably 'Dear John's-John' for the wimp cancer patient  we ridiculed the movie with each  passing soapy stupid line all the way through to the end. There were only about 6 of us in the theater during this 4:45pm Monday matinée and my wife even told me to keep it down so I wouldn't ruin it for the others...it was so bad.  Seeing this on the heels of 'TN' ensured that the rip off similarities were vividly recognizable and Sparks blatant  cheap attempt at template writing painfully obvious. We only wish we could've seen Victoria Day instead...no matter how bad it might've been after seeing this poor entry to cinema. And oh...  for the last 30-minutes  I kept saying ...don't give that cow the coins ...don't give that cow the coins?\n",

After the screening  not only did I want my money refunded  I wanted the 1.5 wasted hours of my life back too. I have a very broad tolerance level when it comes to the indulgences of some European film-making  but this is one of those films that is selected for festivals based on the reputation of the filmmaker alone. This film is proof that while such selections may satisfy the egos of the film-maker and the selection panel  there is absolutely no joy for the audience. There is no character development whatsoever  the plot is a garbled mess  the style is nonsensical  the shot selection is appalling  and the editing is worse. By the end of the first reel  you'll wonder if you walked into the wrong cinema  and by the end of the third reel  you'll be begging to be put out of your misery. This film is an abomination.\n",

      "Don't waste your time. One of those cool-looking boxes that you pick up at Blockbuster on a hunch  but not even worth that. You will NOT say  It's so bad  it's good. Just  It's bad. The Greatest American Hero is a writer who rents a cabin on African island  called Snake Island. Some other tourists are on the boat that drops him off  but they are not staying on the island. They just stop there to let off the writer. Then the boat is stranded there  and --in true Hollywood originality-- the one and only radio on the island is busted. So they start walking around and see a bunch of snakes. Like hundreds of them  which really became annoying and you knew the plot would go nowhere. It's not like there ever was ONE main snake. Like a giant mutated snake or an extra poisonous king of all snakes. Instead  there are just a bunch of ham-and-egger snakes of all kinds of breeds. Their only goal  then  was to escape the island...as opposed to having to conquer the enemy. Because there were so many snakes  you knew they couldn't possibly try to kill them all  and they didn't try. I've seen a similar movie where a town was haunted by snakes and they lead all the snakes into a cave then blew it up. At least then you get the feeling that the good guys killed the bad guys and it was a normal ending. In Snake Island (by the way  every single character was shocked to see snakes on the Island...duhhhhh  it's NAMED Snake Island for a reason)  there was no plan other than trying to get gas for the stupid boat. Oh  they never do get gas by the way. They just happen to find another boat on the island already gassed up.\n",

      "A wonderful semi-humorous homage to Expressionistic black and white films of folks like FW Murnau  Fritz Lang  Carl Dreyer  Marcel Carné and others. Allen plays a character caught in a Kafkaesque nightmare  at first thinking he is part of a vigilante group trying to catch a killer and slowly realizing that he might be a suspect. The writing is a little forced (this is  after all  Woody Allen trying to be a coy Kafka)  but the point is made  and no harm done. The cinematography is interesting  about 100 shades of gray  but make sure you watch in a very dark room with a good screen  or details will get swallowed in the fog. This is an amusing little movie with a few laughs that are actually snorts of uh-huh. The acting is fine  considering the odd vehicle  and it's worth watching if you are big Woody Allen fan. Also of interest to those knowledgeable about Expressionistic films. I'd give this a 6.5 out of 10.\n",

      "I have witnessed some atrocities of cinema. In the past couple of years  it seems producers and directors are bent on making films that drive me closer and closer to insanity. Hannibal was not an exception. I wasn't expecting much  when I went in to see the movie. The book was ridiculous  and the saying  The Book is always better than the movie did not assure me at all that this movie would be anything but trash. But what I came to see was a movie that made all other bad movies seem better in comparison.   Usually  when I see a terrible movie  I find myself more amused than anything else. Sadly though  I could not even laugh at the sad excuse for a film that Hannibal is. The movie was filmed with promise  I guess. It had Anthony Hopkins  Julianne Moore  and Gary Oldman. And for directing  there was Ridley Scott. There have been movies with significantly less talent that have been tremendously better. There was so much I would have cut from this film that I doubt anything would have remained. It was pathetic. The storyline was so ludicrous that it seemed like a complete idiot had written it. What's worse is that the book was even crazier  and there were some scenes that were too extreme to be included  which is sad in the case of a movie where  ***SPOILER AHEAD***   Ray Liotta's brain was being cooked in pieces. That scene more than any other made me want to cry  because it tarnished its predecessor to such a monumental level. Silence of the Lambs was one of my favorite films of all time. But Hannibal was a two hour plus joke. This movie should only be watched  if people want to learn how not to write a good movie.\n",

      "With such a promising cast and a director that I have heard great things about  I was utterly disappointed by this film. It started off with signs of a great epic gangster tale and turned into a completely muddled mess with many unanswered questions and some completely ridiculous and pointless scenes.(and yes I did watch the full length version). I love Robert DeNiro and as usual he did a fine acting job  but in all his other gangster films  no matter how many people he kills  I always still had respect for his character  but in this movie he was a lowlife drug-addict  rapist with no care for anyone but himself. Also  James Woods  another fine actor  had some completely ridiculous scenes written for him. I thought the parts where Robert DeNiro called him crazy and he flipped out came completely out of left-field and towards the end the writers just throw in this random comment about how his father died in a nut house and that's why James Woods didn't like being called crazy. So much was left undeveloped in this movie. Also  we never find out who the men are in the beginning that are trying to kill Noodles and we never find out more about Joe Pesci's character. It seems that the writers threw together about five different stories and never fully explained any of them. The only redeeming quality of the film was the story when the characters were young kids. The story ran smoothly in this part of the movie and the kids did a great acting job. Overall  I was thoroughly disappointed by this movie and I don't see how anyone can even compare this to the Godfather 1 and 2  or even Goodfellas.

      "1st watched 2/18/2007 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Leon Leonard): Fair adventure movie based on a novel by the author of Moby Dick fame  Herman Melville. This movie is about the captain of a ship who had stolen the eyes(that were extremely rare black pearls) from a native tribe's God sculpture and hidden them somewhere that only he knew about before leaving the Island of Tivi. He got very sick and was on a secret voyage to go back to the island to retrieve the pearls for himself while others(like his daughter) thought that he was going back to be treated by the local medicine man. Others didn't know the reason for the voyage. A stowaway actually knew the real reason for the trip -- to return the eyes to their God. The silly part is that the pearls were hidden very close to the statue and all this time the natives ran their tribe without their God having eyes(causing them all kinds of problems). Along the way  we are treated(for some reason) to a short underwater nature show with an electric eel fighting a local octopus(I guess only Herman Melville knows what this was all about). Once they get to the island  the Captain dies but passes the whereabouts of the pearls to his daughter but she also gets the sickness curse as well. One of the bad guys finds out where the God is housed and convinces the daughter to go there and steal back the pearls but at this point the good guys find out what's going on and a fight ensues. I won't tell you the results of the fight or the ending  I'll leave that up to you to find out if you want.

      "I remember when The Love Machine was first released to theaters. I was a mere 13 years old  too young to see the much-ballyhooed motion picture release  but not too old to take my Mom's paperback copy of the Jacqueline Susann novel to school and pore over the 'naughty bits' with my schoolmates.  Though I'm not sure what my problem was at such an early age  but I was very much into the book. I bought and wore an ankh ring just like on the paperback cover  and I remember the ads for the perfume  Xanadu that was cross-promoted and featured clumsily in the film. Despite such an interest I didn't actually see the film until several years later. I should have left things as they were.  The Love Machine is hands down the worst of the many bad films adapted from Susann's novels...which of course makes it the most fun to watch. Its faults are many: from its hopscotching script that jumps choppily from one incident to another with nary a connecting thread; its dated  horny (brass instruments  I mean) music score of ersatz Bacharach; the flat  first-take performances; the boring sexuality -I've never seen bathrobes featured so prominently in a movie before. It's like a fetish! Whenever sex  nudity or something sleazy is called for  out pops somebody in a blue robe! Very odd  that; and most certainly  the circus train of awful 70's fashions that are on endless display. Poor Dyan Cannon's performance (which is no great shakes anyway  but heads over the rest of the cast) is consistently undermined by the jaw-dropping get ups she's called upon to wear. However  the film's chief liability is the stoic  stone-like John Philip Law as (appropriately enough) Robin Stone  the object of every girl's (and one overthe-top flaming male photographer's) affection.  Law is just awful and performs as if he were pulled off the street  handed the pages of the script in hurry and told to give a cold reading on the spot. Just lifeless! Not only that  but he appears in desperate need of a blood transfusion or something. He looks wan and sickly throughout and is several pounds smaller than most of his female costars. Robin Stone should be a hunk  not a hankie.  For anyone finding the film hard going (it's rather slow by today's standards) I beg you to stick around for the climactic fight scene. Here Ms. Cannon (balancing 23 pounds of teased hair) finally abandons her heretofore starchy acting style and lets loose with that infectiously raucous laugh of hers  setting in motion a truly memorable free for all that should have become a cinema clip highlight by now. Trying to rival Valley of the Dolls's infamous wig-down-the-toilet scene  The Love Machine finally does something right.  Jacqueline Susann's unique brand of trash is sorely missed. Perhaps someone out there owns the rights to Rona Barrett's The Lovomaniacs and will revive the genre.\n",

      "..well it doesn't really have one. The Judge has his house rammed into by a big rig and you never know what happens. Does he live? Norris never even gets to trash him. In the meantime Norris takes on some thug cop at the end. Who cares? Norris also manages to take on everyone in town  gets his hand broken and shot in the side and goes on to keep fighting. Come on! This movie was apparently made to cash in on the CB craze of the time  why there was one is beyond me. They barley even use the CB's in the movie. Adding to this  the movie near the end seems to drag on and you wonder why it's not over yet. This movie is bad  but if you're bored and need something to watch it will pass the time. As far as Norris he went on to make much better films than this. 3 out of 10.\n",

Don't expect an Abyss or Alien  just a (very) low-budget horror/adventure movie.  There is one nice splattermoment when a guy's head is shot off  but for the most  the horror is pretty tame.

      "I've spent a year deployed in Iraq  and amongst the hundreds of movies I've seen here was this little gem called Vampire Assassin. Judging from the cover (African-American with corn-rows with a curved blade  leather coat and the demeanor of a badass)  I expected a Blade rip-off. Fair enough.  So I pop it in and observed a borderlined overweight African-American with no blade  no cornrows and  well  nothing at all really except...I don't know. If you've read any of these other reviews  you get the gist of the flick. It sucks. Bad. Really bad.  I don't know if it was the Highlander-esquire lightning after killing an immortal vampire  or the karate-kick sound effects for camera zooms  or the twenty dollar budget on props  or the ok  we have 90 minutes to film this before we're caught filming in a Johnson & Johnson parking lot  or the martial arts that is as exciting and fast-paced as two old people having sex  or the 7th grade acting talent  or the eccentric Asian Master who's either senial or on acid  or what  but the movie manages to force you to question your existence. And that's awesome.  Not many movies can be so bad that your head will explode like Scanners. If you heckle (or MST3K) with your friends  this is the flick for you. I've seen it three times already  and I think it might've caused permanent damage on my psyche. If you STILL don't have any clue as to the quality of the film  people were trying to give it away for free and no one would take it. Not even by force.  Long story short  watch it. Either as masochistic pleasure or punishment. It will rock your skull (and for the most part  for all the wrong reasons).\n",

      "Without being really the worst science fiction film ever made  or the worst I have seen  'Time Under Fire' is still much under average. The premises and the first 10-15 minutes are not that bad  it starts as a X-Files story  combining Bermuda triangle mysteries with time travel. Pretty soon elements of other genres (too many) mix together  but the story never takes off beyond the level of interest of a TV series. Soon  'Time Under Fire' quickly degenerates into a series of clichés  not only mixing altogether too many genres but also being unable to create anything memorable in suspense or special effects that would help viewers remember the movie until tomorrow. Acting is bad  and the rhetoric lines in the script do not help at all.\n",

      "My wife invited my son and I to watch this on cable TV on a lazy Saturday evening  thinking that it might show an unusual role for Juliette Lewis. On this promise  at least  the movie delivers: her character is ineffectual  adhering to nearly every slasher-type horror movie cliche. As does the movie. A cataloguing of its studied adherence to them would be an exercise in recall of something I hope to quickly forget  so I won't make one. Basically  this is a whodunnit  heavy on the red herrings: everybody appears guilty  rather than just the two one suspects from the beginning. The rule out the logical and obvious  and what's left is it rule of bad horror movies works well on this one. The only surprise to have any impact on me was its final snagging of the indeterminate ending cliche: will Jane keep her appointment with her attempted rescuer  who will tell her the (obvious to the audience) identity of the 2nd conspirator  propelling her into another round of hysterical victim-play. Mercifully  I will never know.\n",

      "Happy Days was produced and broadcast from the mid-1970's to the early 1980's and seems to get more ridiculous with age. At the time of its broadcast  most viewers who grew up in the 1950's were in middle age with families  and the scenes at Mel's Diner probably brought an artificial nostalgia to them. The Fonz was of course the coolest of the cool (although the actor Henry Wrinkler to this day has never learned how to ride a motorcycle). Richie Cunningham was the all-American blond-haired kid who would probably be elected student body president. Potsie was Richie's best friend--the star of the show has to have a best friend  I guess. And Ralph Malph was the bumbling sidekick to the Fonz  if not the entire group. I loved it when the Fonz would beat up on poor Ralph Malph. And there was Mel  the middle-aged lug who ran Mel's Diner. And of course who could forget the appearance of Mork? Was this really the 1950's? Ironically  films produced during the 1950's  such as Rebel Without a Cause and The Wild One have gotten better with age and portray the period more honestly than this show which was produced 20 years after the period it portrays.  Unfortunately  the TV show Happy Days is not in the same league as Rebel Without a Cause or American Graffitti for that matter. Happy Days may have captured some aspects of the 1950's with its burger diner  juke boxes  cool cars  and tacky plaid shirts  but it is more a nostalgic idealism done strictly for laughs rather than an honest portrayal. American Graffitti had something to say about young Americans in the 1950's whereas Happy Days seemed more about what middle-aged people of the 1970's wished the 1950's had been like. The result was a kind of watered down fabrication that really has nothing to do with the 1950's. Happy Days is  at best  a comedy-fantasy with some of the artificial culture of the 1950's as its backdrop. As pointed out by another reviewer  the all-American kid Richie Cunningham would probably have been chastised for befriending the likes of a drop-out like Fonzie. And Mel would probably forbid Fonzie from entering his Diner.  A quick history: Happy Days was originally a pilot called Love in the Happy Days that was rejected for broadcast. Comedy pilots that had themes concerning sex and romance that did not make it to pilot airing sometimes appeared on the infrequently broadcast show Love American Style which was often aired in place of baseball games that had rained out or other unexpected programming cancellations and/or alterations. In short  Love American Style was a throw-away show that contained all these one-episode comedy pilots that never made it to a slotted debut. Love in the Happy Days did appear as a Love American Style show sometime in the early 1970's  but at the time TV executives could not foresee how a show about 1950's young people would be popular  particularly during the hey-day of comedy shows centering around middle-aged people  such as The Mary Tyler Moore Show (and its subsequent spin-offs such Rhoda)  The Bob Newhart Show  and All in the Family. (How things have changed since now most TV sitcoms are about young people and the industry avoids most shows about middle-aged people like the plague!)   Subsequently  one of the young stars of Love in the Happy Days  a child actor from The Andy Griffith Show named Ron Howard  got the chance to star in a film about young people taking place in 1959 called American Graffitti directed by the relatively unknown George Lucas whose previous THX 1138 had bombed miserably at the box office. Even when it was premiered to movie executives  again the studios could not see how a movie about young people in the 1950's could become popular because it didn't fit with what had been popular in the past  although they didn't realize that much of the movie-going audience had been young in the 1950's. As everyone knows  the movie was a huge hit  and studio executives recognized that they had completely misjudged their audience. Somewhere during the theatrical run of American Graffitti  TV executives realized they had a comedy pilot in their vault that was a lot like American Graffitti. They brought it back with the original cast  plus Henry Wrinkler as The Fonz  re-titled it Happy Days and the rest is TV history as it became one of the most popular shows of the 1970's.  Happy Days now seems ridiculous. The characters are flat and cardboard  never being more or less than what they superficially are. The issues they deal with are trivial. And their reactions appear mindless and even silly. Nowadays  the character of the Fonz seems to be a caricature of  well  The Fonz. Was the idea to be a kind of parody of Marlon Brando's character in The Wild One? Looking on the show with fresh eyes  I feel the producers really missed out on a great opportunity to present the 1950's with depth and realism that still could be fun and entertaining. Instead the producers decided on cheap laughs for quick bucks. This is definitely a show that has not withstood the test of time. American Graffitti has many of the outward appearances of Happy Days but it had an edge. It had an honesty about the characters and their issues. Happy Days took the look of American Graffitti but failed to take its heart.\n",

      "The film opens with a cult leader attempting to resurrect a dead member with his followers chanting for his rebirth as the sun strikes upon them in the desert. Reanhauer(Bill Roy)believes wholeheartedly in his power  and gets so worked up that he collapses with what appeared to be a heart attack. Unable to keep him alive  all those involved  doctors and nurses  are sentenced for attack with Reanhauer's demonic spirit invading the curvaceous body of nurse Sherri(..big-chested Jill Jacobson)targeting each one using her as a tool of vengeance. Forced against her will  with no memory of inflicting such harm  Sherri's host body murders selected victims. Fortunately  Sherri's fellow co-worker  nurse Tara(Marilyn Joi)begins a rather blossoming romance with a blinded patient  Marcus Washington(Prentiss Moulden)  once a star football player  whose mother was a practitioner of voodoo. Through Marcus' knowledge  passed down from mom  Tara finds out about possession and how to possibly save Sherri before she murders everyone unknowingly. Meanwhile  Sherri's lover  Dr. Peter Desmond(Geoffrey Land)worries about her present condition and welfare.  Well  this was my first Al Adamson film and I must agree with his detractors that  just from this film alone  it seems he holds them together with paper clips and Elmer's glue. The animation with which we see the spirit take control of Sherri is beyond awful and rather laughable. A little soft-core nonsense as filler  some demonic possession thrown in the mix(Sherri actually speaks in another voice when she's possessed)  with naughty nurse behavior(..the three nurses focused on in the film all are quite sexually active and free-spirited)and a little bit violence/gore. The film is essentially shot in tiny rooms with dull dialogue from a rather mundane cast. The sexual situations aren't that hard-core and Al often shoots them without revealing all that much. The film looks embarrassingly cheap and there's an absence of thrills  although the chilling score(..which sounds like something from Dark Shadows)does help a little bit. Jacobson and Mary Kay Pass(..as nurse Beth who seems to be a nymphomaniac if she'll even screw a nutty patient  always complaining of illnesses he really doesn't have  with enough chest hair to declare him a Neanderthal)aren't bad looking  and Adamson's story-line  although frail  is somewhat coherent(..it seems he rarely directs films which are). Overall  the movie looks like it cost 5 bucks and Adamson just can not overcome the budgetary restrictions(..or  in my opinion  create an unpleasant enough atmosphere due to a sometimes plodding narrative and tedious scenes which do little for the story). John F Goff has the role of the hospital's psychiatrist who wants to commit Sherri  not believing the idea that she was possessed;he constantly bickers with Peter over her. I watched the unrated lost version which I guess is the real version to watch of Nurse Sherri.\n",

      "This movie was really bad  plain and simple. How a movie like this gets wide release is a wonder to me.  It's a decent idea  but it just didn't flesh out. Edward Burns is a decent actor though. I liked his small role in Saving Private Ryan.  Let's get down to the big issue here.  The visuals were so incredibly bad  I thought I was watching an old Dinosaurs In 3D CDROM point-and-click adventure demo on Windows 3.1 I mean  I've seen cut-scenes in console games from pre-2000 that have better looking dinosaurs than this. I mean  heck... the original Tomb Raider T-Rex looked better than this one.  The lizard-monkeys were laughable. I thought they were some sort of ripoff creation from Killer Instinct I've seen better sock-puppet monsters now that I think about it.  You know  there's a ton of made-for-TV movies that are better than this.

      "Having watched the first scene  I realized the acting was so bad that it couldn't possibly pick up later. Superficial and artificial  with frequent attempts to look professional through references to technology the way a five year-old tries to make it sound as if he knows what he's talking about.   The second-to-second storyline is completely unrealistic and just about every single decision the screenwriter did  was the kind you expect from a below-average grade school student. The overall storyline was as unoriginal and predictable as a pack of sausages. The few attempts to make the dialogs sound intelligent  was limited to neurotic  apologetic behavior. A ten year-old might like it. But it would take a five year-old to accept the lack of realism; How does advanced cell function allow someone to bypass a code lock by touching it as if with a magic wand  pick out one out of 100s of voices through a ventilation system (thereby ripping off Superman)  and repair a home computer by just sensing whats wrong instead of looking for faults? Actually  that scene is a neat example: The fault was that one of the cooling pipes (aluminum ribbons) on the CPU was broken  the way it would look if a exhaust pipe on a V8 engine is ripped off by an explosion. This is something that can't happen  and if it did  it wouldn't prevent the computer from working. There is no electrical current passing through this ribbon  but when he (without doing it himself  his arms worked by autopilot because the cells in his body was super efficient) put a push-pin into the rip  a desktop with icons appeared on the screen immediately without booting.  And so it goes all the way. Like when he escaped an interrogation room in the NSA headquarters by lighting a lighter below a fire sensor  resulting in open doors throughout the building. Naturally  NSA didn't predict this sharp witted approach to escaping  nor did they put any guards outside his room (or anywhere else) to guard a living  walking breakthrough in military nanotechnology. So he walked out and got a cab. Examples like this one are not only numerous  there is in fact just about no single scene that makes sense.   Also  the so-called great effects were terrible. He threw a basketball back to a kid in the park  and the kid was thrown back horizontally 20 feet into a tree. No acceleration or deceleration  but constant speed and height  like a motorized trolley. I'm sure if I paused and looked for the cables that kept the posture of this kid the way only cables can  they probably didn't know how to or bother to erase them completely. If someone is thrown that far into a tree  they would at least say ouch (or rather be hospitalized with broken bones)  but the kid was just just confused and amazed.  Moronic. That's the word for every creative decision made throughout the entire production. I'm going to put the director's name on my own personal blacklist  someone as poorly skilled as him cannot improve. I feel like demanding compensation for having wasted 45 minutes of my life for watching it  and the time it took to write this. Although it felt therapeutic  it was traumatic to realize how little it takes to get a pilot approved. The only excuse a slightly intelligent person could have to watch this voluntarily  would be imprisonment or lobotomy.\n",

      "It's times like these I truly wish I was a more avid reader of Clive Barker's literary repertoire  since very few things feel worse than not being able to fully comprehend a movie of this stunningly 'visual' caliber. Based on the novella Cabal  the story of Nightbreed involves a behemothic amount of lavish and bizarre creatures and settings in an underground society of demonic ghouls. A normal guy becomes linked to the strange world  called Midian  through his dreams and his psychiatrist coerces him into believing he is responsible for a series of gruesome murders of families in recent months... Thinking this to be true  he retreats to Midian - located under a rural cemetery - where he is reluctantly accepted. The shrink  however  is right on Homeboy's heals with a diabolical scheme to whip out the community of Nightbreeds...  Wanting so much to love this movie  I was very let down in the long run. I have regretfully not read the story so Barker's fantasy world and the purpose of it and all these monsters was horribly confusing and the premise was painfully uneven. I understand how the final cut was diced to hell and even Barker show's moderate dislike for the overall product  but I just didn't get it. Even if it is crucial to read the story  I feel like it should at least be translated to film in a way that it is still comprehensible for those unfamiliar with the literature. If Cabal is as convoluted as this film than Barker really milked a dead concept. Couldn't help but feel a bit bored after a while  especially when things started getting increasingly ridiculous (somewhere around the jail scene I realized just how bored I was) - like a police department fearlessly going to war with Midian like it happens every week! No one seems to think the idea of immortal monsters is a tad... strange. I DID like the visual effects and all that crazy sh*t that went on in Midian  especially that porcupine lady and that big headed SOB... Definitely an epic flick when you consider the massive quantity of effects and convincingly morbid decor. David Cronenberg fills his position well as the loony shrink with his cool zipper-head potato sack mask  but we ALL wish he had done some behind-the-camera work to help save this heap...   So  if you have a boner for Clive Barker material and fully grasp what exactly Midian is  why they show the creatures during the opening title sequence (terrible idea!)  and why these creatures reside there and how some punk kid shares a telekinetic link to it  you should probably check out Nightbreed. I'll look for Cabal one of these days and hopefully gain some perspective... Or maybe I'll just forget this travesty completely... Until then  this is a poorly constructed and fairly tedious mess of a movie... Watch Hellraiser instead.\n",

What I got was a documentary type look at an average guys life who happened to be really good at cards. Do I want to see the romance with his wife? NO Do I want to see about everything that went on in this guy's life except poker? NO. Well thats what you get with this film. The acting is good for such a low budget piece of crap. The film never tries to break the mold or do anything original. It simply sleep walks its way through the script. The ending is disappointing and never really looks deep into Ungar's mind. Instead it focuses on what was already obvious. He was a drugged out card player with an average life not unlike any other average joe in vegas. The movie focuses on the aspects of his life that were UN extraordinary rather than the Extraordinary. The poker scenes in the entire film add up to about 4 minutes of footage. Ungar's achievements of winning the WSOP 3 times seem life after thoughts. A 10 year old could do a better job directing this movie.. or maybe it was the script being a piece of crap from the beginning that doomed this joke of a movie.

In these times of remakes and sequels and film companies trying to cash in on any winning combination of cinematic components  The Cavern has only one relatively different twist on the previous eight cave movies over the last few years  and that twist seems to be taken from an X-File. I like to give every film the benefit of the doubt  but there were just too many little annoyances for me here. The camera work can give you a headache as they seem to constantly confuse which way is up. Not being a caver  it doesn't really matter to me whether the filming was realistic. There is entirely too much unnecessary PANNICK from supposedly experienced cavers  by the last half you're saying out loud one of two things  oh just shut up and concentrate on saving yourselves  or I hope you all die by the end. It must have been very tiring for these decent actors to make this film. A moderate amount of gore and nothing special in the dialog or characters. While you're pretty confident you know what's going on by the end  the last five minutes explain all the details. But I would have had a better opinion of the movie if they would have left the last minute on the cutting room floor. It just wasn't necessary. I suggest you hit eject immediately after your suspicions are confirmed and save yourself the setup for the sequel. I've long thought that the film industry should share a modified restaurant industry's checkout scheme. You pay for the materials to make the film before you go in  but any profits for the film come from the tips you give when you leave the cinema. I can't blame what I don't like about this film on its low budget.\n",

      "...at least during its first half. If it had started out with the three buddies in the navy and concentrated on the naval action scenes  it would have been a much better and tighter film. The second half of the film is worth it  especially for the action sequences and close up shots of early 20th century ships  but it's like a dull toothache getting there. Also  don't watch this film just because Ginger Rogers is in it. She has an important role  but it's a small one.  The film starts out showing three New York City buddies working the tourist trade and also in good-natured competition for the hand of Sally (Ginger Rogers)  a singing candy salesgirl along the avenue. World War I breaks out  the three buddies seem completely indifferent to the struggle  yet enlist in the navy anyways. The one of the three with the least industry as a civilian (Bill Boyd as Baltimore) winds up the commanding officer to the other two (Robert Armstrong as Dutch and James Gleason as Skeets). To make matters more complex  Sally has fallen in love with one of the three  but doesn't have the chance to tell him before the three sail off to war.  The film is a little more interesting on board ship  mainly because of the close shots we have of the ship itself  and also because the chemistry among the three buddies is believable. However  James Gleason at age 49 looks a bit long in the tooth to be a swabby  especially when the sign at the enlistment office said you had to be between 17 and 35 to be eligible.  One real obvious flaw in the film that made me believe that everything outside the naval scenes was slapped together with minimum care is the costume design  or  I should say  the lack of it. In the scenes in New York just prior to WWI we have everyone dressed in the fashions of 1931 and everyone driving the cars of 1931 - no effort was taken to bring this film into period.  In conclusion  if you watch the few scenes with Ginger Rogers in them and the last 45 minutes involving the naval suicide mission  you've seen everything here worth seeing. The rest is padding.\n",

      "Hellraiser: Bloodline is only a so-so film. I believe it's the fourth installment in the Hellraiser series.  I missed the beginning  and all I remember from there was some topless women and a box-shape thing on a computer screen. But  using my wit and intelligence  (and the Info Button) I soon found out that the villain (Pinhead) was released from Pandora's Box  which  I believe is a gateway straight to Hell.  So  anyways  Pinhead somehow comes out of the box and terrorizes the Toymaker's family. And  that's about it. Oh  and not to mention the random tortures of various people that cross his path. Yawn.  What mainly happens in this film is that Pinhead captures the kid  and then unleashes the dog on his wife  and then kills a random person. Then he husband comes along  blah  blah  blah. Who cares? Why it fails is because Hellraiser: Bloodline is too corny to be scary. Look at Pinhead's minion of creatures: a cheesy dog that looks like it's been turned inside out  two men whose heads and bodies are connected together  (Siamese twins in a horror film?) and some person who is supposed to be a princess of some sort. (I haven't seen the previous films.) Now look at the main villain. His name is Pinhead. Isn't that the name you call somebody when they're stupid? He has pins in his head and hooks coming out of his fingers  and he has blue skin. I suppose he would make a decent villain if he didn't have such a corny name  and a corny speech. Somewhere in the film  two cops approach him and say Don't make us put some pain on you! Pinhead replies Pain? How dare you use that word! I AM pain",
      " blah  blah  blah  blah blah. It sounds a bit cliché if you ask me.  Don't forget the final half of the movie. The characters (and audience) get to experience more torture when Pinhead attacks some futuristic asylum. Some person who we don't recognize (Maybe he was in the previous films. I don't remember him in the beginning of the movie.) This scene is basically one thing played over and over again:   A guard goes to inspect a mysterious noise.  Some other guard: Oh no! He's down. I will go check on him",
      "by myself!  After he dies the same thing happens again.  (SPOILERS) Here's the thing I didn't get. In the film Pinhead is supposedly sent to Oblivion at the end. So  how does he come back for another four films? Are they prequels? Why hasn't he died in the previous ones? Geez. The makers need to come up with an idea for a different series. (END OF SPOILERS) Hellraiser: Bloodline is gory and full of torture scenes  but has little thrill or scare value. Just forget it. Bad special effects with bad",
      "everything else make this more of a snooze-fest than a good horror.  Good: Well",
      "some people may enjoy the topless women in the beginning. Plus  Pinhead's voice is pretty cool. I suppose if you like ultra-violence  you might like this too.  Bad: None of the reasons above make this a very good film. The corniness and repetitiveness are pretty bad. And  who names their villain Pinhead?

      "The commercials for RAT RACE made it look too juvenile for me to enjoy  but since my boyfriend adores this movie (and the soundtrack)  I finally relented and watched it with him tonight. I make him watch David Lynch films and all sorts of obscure indie stuff (I recently forced URBANIA on him)  so I felt I owed him an innocuous Hollywood product.  I didn't want to hurt his feelings  so I saved my bitching for y'alls. Yeah  RAT RACE has its moments  but a great deal of it irritated me. Let's start at the beginning. RAT RACE was marketed as a family film  so I was a little surprised to discover that the first scene centered around a porno movie. (I can hear it now: Mommy  what does AFRO WHORES mean?) This scene has no purpose in this movie other than to cram some naughtiness into a PG-13 movie.  And while we're still on the segments in the casino  it's pretty convenient that all the characters happened to play  within the same time frame  the slots that held the gold coins. What would have happened if they didn't? Would those millionaire gamblers just sit around and wait? And how did they get those gold coins in the slots in the first place?  But I'm belaboring a plot point that's necessary for the movie to exist  so I'll press on. About Whoopi and her long-lost daughter: they're meeting for the very first time  yet throughout their whole ordeal they don't discuss with each other anything about themselves. Why make their relationship such a presumably complicated one? Couldn't they have just been  say  a mother and daughter on vacation together? Why the business concerning a long-ago adoption? And why portray the daughter as a hard driving career woman chained to her cell phone who never again needs contact with her business? Did the screenplay just forget about this subplot and character trait?  This illustrates the main weakness of this movie - the characters are inconsistent and interchangeable; it's exhausting when everyone is equally zany and with no identifying traits. And another thing - the events aren't plausible. Oh  sure  the characters can do some quirky things  but the characters themselves have to be believable. Take THE NAKED GUN (another Jerry Zucker movie) for example. Frank Drebin has some pretty exaggerated moments  but everything he does is  in theory  possible in his world. (Jane is also funny  but it's a different kind of funny  which makes all the difference.) A character in RAT RACE defying natural laws by leaping onto a speeding train destroys any plausibility the movie may have; these clearly aren't real people  so why should I care about them?  Another problem I have with RAT RACE is a moral one. The characters obtain their modes of transport almost totally by theft. I know  I know  this is just a silly comedy  and the same actions didn't bother me fifteen years ago when I saw MILLION DOLLAR MYSTERY  but there's a lot of lawbreaking in RAT RACE  and it bothers me now. And I won't delve into the whole airport-sabotage sequence other than to wonder if the screenwriters didn't consider the real-life implications of such an action; was that scene funny before 9/11?  I'll skip over the distasteful bits concerning the heart  the drugging of one's family and the Nazis (whose buildup and payoff worked better in an episode of Seinfeld)  and move on to complain about the acting. Rowan Atkinson started out annoying and ended insufferable; I don't know when I liked a comical character less. And the three Oscar winners need new agents. Whoopi came off best  but she didn't have much to work with (loved the copper perm and purple lipstick though); Kathy Bates' part was shrill but mercifully brief; Cuba  was...oh  man. Cuba  babe  please fire your agent! Following INSTINCT and CHILL FACTOR  this is your third strike (be glad I haven't seen PEARL HARBOR or SNOW DOGS) - it's time to give your '97 Best Supporting Actor Oscar back to its rightful owner (Edward Norton  for PRIMAL FEAR). An actor of your stature has no business running half-naked through the desert and being checked out by a transvestite Lucille Ball impersonator. Do you even read the scripts to your movies anymore  or are you reaching into a bag and pulling your next project out at random?  There's other small points that bother me (how did Grisham and the hooker get to the loot so fast?)  but  basically  RAT RACE amounts to little more than your basic batch of character types being hindered by arbitrary obstacles on their way to a rather underwhelming and inexplicable ending. They give the money to charity? What kind of ending is that?!? Yeah  it's the noble thing to do. Never mind the probability of cross-promotion/licensing whores Smash Mouth (do they ever say no to selling out?) putting on a benefit concert in the middle of the New Mexico desert  but who would honestly do such a thing? Yes  they say it's the journey  not the destination  that makes a trip worthwhile  but there's no journey without a destination. If there was ever an example of a wrong happy ending  this would be it. What a bummer end to a movie that  despite my nitpicking here  I did enjoy parts of (I confess to enjoying the bit with the cow and some of the Lucy stuff along with the character with the tongue piercing - at first I thought his indecipherable speech would run me up a wall  but he grew to be my favorite).  But as far as my boyfriend knows  I found RAT RACE quite funny and charming.  \n",

      "I thought this was an extremely bad movie. The whole time I was watching this movie I couldn't help but think over and over how bad it is  and how that was $3.69 down the drain. The plot was so jumpy. They did an excellent job at the beginning of explaining who dated who in high school  but they never really explained anything after that. Was it a supernatural thriller? Was it a regular thriller? Apparently you can decide for yourself  because they didn't see the need to explain. I understood basically what happened  I think. What I got confused about was all of it prior  what was the deal with the bloody noses  phone calls  etc.? Was this guy coming back? Was the wife channeling Carrie or something? Who knows? You certainly won't after watching this movie.\n",

      "Disclaimer: During my ventures into foreign cinema  I have taken a liking to a wide variety of movies that span different genres that include horror  action  drama  comedy  and romance  to name a few. Thus  I have enjoyed the thoughtful  serious tone of dramas as well as the mindless  popcorn fun of action films. With a wide array of Chinese  Japanese  and Korean movies under my belt  I am confident in my ability to recognize bright spots in movies to appreciate and complement. Unfortunately  Ashes of Time has nothing to recognize. It is one of the worst Chinese movies I have ever seen.  To start off  this overrated swordplay epic showcases the infamous slideshow action sequence throughout  which is nothing more than an ultra-cheap and pathetic form of action choreography. One simply needs to show a series of close-up pictures of grimising faces  swords  legs and/or arms  and then a dead body. Bravissimo! You now have an action sequence for Ashes of Time. The problem lies not only in its poor quality but also in the fact that the scenes are so chaotic and disjointed that the viewer has no idea what the hell is going on.  The dramatic element of this film is nonexistent  as it relies on the characters telling the viewer that they love someone or hate someone instead of actually developing and showing such elements on screen  which renders all characters generic and colorless  leaving the viewer completely indifferent to their actions. In fact  the storyline itself is an absolute disaster  introducing way too many characters way too quickly with way too many plot devices. Plot complexities in films can be used very advantageously (i.e.  A Tale of Two Sisters)  but Ashes of Time becomes exploitative trash when it does nothing more than convolute a very simple plot for no apparently good reason.  In fact  this entire movie acts like a series of smokescreens to cover up its deficiencies. Horrible action choreography is covered up by slideshow tricks and chaotic camera movements. Non-existent character development is covered up by the characters overtly saying how they feel. And a thoughtless storyline is covered up by confusing the viewer with convolution.  As if this weren't bad enough  this movie was extremely boring  seeming more like 150 minutes instead of the actual 95.  Rating = A rarely given 0/5 Stars.\n",

      "This is the first porn I've ever tried to review. It demands a different approach than usual  since the allegory will not reward dissection. I'm American. I'm a prudish virgin. We are European. We are cultured and sex-mad. It is nice when we all screw each other. Lots to talk about! Well  there kind of is in fact  relative to your average 60s topless volleyball number anyway. And the enervating patina of 'class' at least delivers clean  detailed compositions. But what the hell kind of thing is that to say about a porn? OK then: the only scene I really (rhetorically) got off on was the first time Brigitte Maier steps in. There are efforts to toss in a nice variety of race and age while letting no two men anywhere near each other; the one black guy suffers a premature bout of editorial coitus interruptus. And multiple takes or not  one perhaps undescribable-on-IMDb act does look like it was partially simulated by a surgical hose.

      "There is a LOT of repetitive dialogue in this movie about cold spots (signaling the presence of a ghost)  and characters praying to surround themselves with white light to protect themselves. To recreate the feeling of the movie  I shall repeatedly make references to cold spots throughout this review. I'e seen worse movies than the St. Francisville Experiment  but this may be the most *forgettable* one of all (it's getting cold!) Basically some 20-somethings spend the night at a haunted house. This is filmed as a supposedly true documentary. It's obviously not real  but the house does contain some cold spots. SPOILERS- (as if you won't be able to predict most of the plot!). Not much happens in this film. We have the time-honored horror cliche of a cat jumping out of hiding near the beginning  as a practice scare to warm up the audience. The people wander around with flashlights  occasionally taking a moment to remind the house that they come in peace- that they mean no harm to the spirits (or cold spots) within. Now and then a door will swing shut and startle somebody. Of course   the ouija board makes an appearance. They chat with a ghost named Charles. A girl eats a sandwich with a cockroach in it. More cold spots. Another door swings shut and some guy goes off about the scuff sound of the door. Scuff  scuff  he says. Oh my god  somebody says. Surround yourself with white light. I admit there is a good scene in the attic (where a chair is knocked over by a ghost) that really caught me off guard. But aside from some funny bad dialogue  the chair scene (the actual split-second when it is knocked over  nothing immediately before or after that moment) is the only good thing in this movie. However there are still some cold spots in here. Eventually  the movie ends. Nobody dies. No more details necessary. I wasn't a big fan of Blair Witch Project  but it looks like a masterpiece next to the St. Francisville Experiment. You may find yourself not debating whether or not this is a real documentary  but whether or not it was intended to be funny. I still don't know. But whatever it was intended to be  it failed.\n",

      "Greetings  Moviegoers! As I watch Octopus II  I contemplate the inherent lameness of the Octopus/Croc/Dino Horror Genre. Many moviegoers may blame the poor acting  nonsensical screenplay  or poorly constructed plot as the reasons that cause the OCD movie to flounder. These reasons may indeed be floundering factors  but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an OCD movie that is at the heart of the lameness.  You see  the technology does not yet exist to make a realistic  life-size OCD and the CGI technology currently used by studios lacks the ability to blend in smoothly with real world environments and characters. Even with clever cinematography  you can only film the semi-dark depths of the sea/semi-dark forest/semi-dark cave/semi-dark corridor so many times before the Sci-Fi aficionado becomes bored with the genre entirely (the OCD sub-genre  that is).  What can be done  you ask? I wouldn't suggest that the genre surrender to cheesiness  but another avenue needs to be explored. We can't really go back to the days of the Fade-to-Black cue that someone has been killed. Or can we? If we can't reach the goal of realism  we have to compensate in other ways  such as plot twists  innuendo  and photo-ingenuity.  It will be through ingenious and alternate methods that the disease of lameness  so common to the OCD sub-genre  will be cured.\n",

      "Mickey Rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment... and fair play to him. I always liked his image and his acting ability in such fare as Angel Heart and Johnny Handsome. You know what you are going to get with Rourke - mean  moody  dirty. But this film gives you much more - and you don't want most of it.  First and foremost - this whole thing just doesn't make sense. Rourke is a hardened IRA killer who after killing a bus-load of schoolchildren flees Ireland for London. He is on the run from the cops and from his own Army comrades. He has also vowed to never kill again. It looks like the bus full of kids finally did it for him.  However  when he gets to London he is tracked down by a local mobster (Bates - looking like his eyebrows and hair came straight off a Burton's dummy) to kill his main competitor in turn for £50 000 and a boat trip to the US. Rourke reluctantly agrees to do it but is seen by a priest (Hoskins) and confesses the crime to him in the confessional in order to keep the priest's mouth shut. He figures it is better than killing him.  A wealth of things arise here which just don't add up :   1. Why pick Rourke to off your competition? As is illustrated by a scene whereby an employee is pinned to a wall by a couple of heavies with what look like awls - these London guys are tough enough anyway to do their own killing.  2. Not only that but the Mobster gets a guy to follow Rourke and witness the killing with his own eyes. Why didn't that guy simply kill the competitor and save all the hassle of dealing with Rourke?   3.Hoskins sees the murder take place and the police let him go off - without protection  I may add - to take confession? No way.  4. Rourke hangs around the church (right next to where he carried out the murder ) immediately after the crime takes place to go to confession. Why aren't the cops checking the place out?   5. Rourke hangs around the church and Hoskin's blind niece in particular  for days afterward without anybody bothering him. What? He's on the run and he stays put by the very place where he committed another murder? Stupid.  6. The cops actually meet Rourke in the church fixing the organ and have no idea who he is. Do they not know he is on the run for the school bus bombing? They don't even check up on him?   7. Why get Rourke to kill for you  and then tell him to wait around for a few days to get on the boat? You'd think you'd want to get rid of him immediately. Or kill him. One or the other?   8. Why does Bates' brother suddenly decide to rape the blind niece in the midst of all the waiting? Could he not restrain himself for a few days? At least until Rourke has been safely offed to the States? Ridiculous.  9. Rourke suddenly has inner turmoil after all his years of killing and wins over the blind niece immediately - even after she knows he is a killer  she still loves him? Again - utterly ludicrous. And besides - she falls in love with him in record time - a few days !!!!   10. The whole bomb thing at the end is just plain silly from Bates' point of view.  11. Things happen in parts of this film that just do not make sense or are simply in there to help the storyline (and I say that in jest) along. Bates' houses Rourke in a whorehouse until the boat is ready to sail and Rourke suddenly displays a moral high ground to respect the whore in the house - but yet will bed a blind girl.  12. Rourke asks a henchman on the boat where Bates is - and the henchman practically spurts out the entire movements of his boss in less than 10 seconds. It was embarrassing - the guy was telling Rourke far more than he even asked.  13. Hoskin's priest is an ex-army guy and we see him beat up three henchmen behind a pub. Totally uncalled-for and yet another cringe-worthy scene.  I'm gonna stop there at unlucky 13 without mentioning Rourke's hair (so falsely red it is laughable)  his accent (which to be fair is not too bad sometimes but deteriorates to a barely heard mumble at other times)  his clothes  walk  looks to the heavens etc. Nor will I mention the music and the choppy editing style.  Oooppps - I have just mentioned them.  Overall - a disaster of a film with some obvious religious imagery thrown in (Rourke on the cross  preaching from a pulpit) which would embarrass a first year film student never mind a top star and director.  4/10.\n",

      "Talk about rubbish! I can't think of one good thing in this movie. The screenplay was poor  the acting was terrible and the effects  well there were no effects. I can't believe the writer of this movie did Identity  everything in this movie made me sick to start to finish.  The front cover of the video box shows a showman with shark like teeth and scary eyes. I looks like a scary villain  but like the old saying never judge a book by it's cover  the whole villain looked like a cardboard cut out. One part in the film a girl gets killed by a salad tongs  terrible. The setting was bad enough  like they could of set the whole thing in Lapland but no  a tropical island instead.  I took this movie as a spoof  which I think they wanted it to be but the only thing that made me laugh in a bad way was the tacky effects. You can argue that I haven't watched the first one  but seeing this I would be safe if I wouldn't attempted it.  The biggest joke in this movie is the effects  the snowballs looked like they were home made  and that carrot was a complete embarrassment. If I would of guess the budget of this movie would of probably be between 8 to 9 pounds fifty. The producer in a last minute panic must of grabbed the actors for the street gave them the script told them they have 6 minutes to practise these lines and shoot on a island.  Lastly the acting in the film was painful  it was like the actors forgot their ordinary lines and made them up the way through.  In conclusion I give this film: 0 stars out of 5\n",

      "This movie is honestly one of the greatest movies of all time...if you suffer from insomnia. It is a fool-proof way to guarantee hours of sleep at a time. As the movie slowly progresses  the audience slips into a state of unconsciousness and gradually loses sight of any sort of plot that the movie might actually contain. This effect is surely created due to the lack of sweet action/sweet babes.  Also  Mr. Eisenstein was obviously unable to master the art of montage. A prime example of this is the scene on the Odessa steps. For no apparent reason  an event that in real life would have taken a matter of seconds is transformed into a seven minute nightmare for any sane viewer. This editing flaw tarnishes any sort of realism in the entire film. Honestly  i've seen more realistic editing watching cartoons.  Some individuals who have commented on this title have hailed Battleship Potemkin as: One of the greatest movies of all time and  Truly a masterpiece. Well i'm writing this comment to persuade readers to avoid watching this film at all costs. My best guess is that my fellow Potemkin critics simply wrote the wrong words in their summaries. Surely what they meant to say was: One of the greatest snooze-fests of all time and  Truly an epic fail.  In conclusion  don't waste your time. If you are interested in watching a movie of far superior quality  go to www.youtube.com and watch a Halo 3 montage. If i played the movie Battleship Potemkin in a game of slayer on guardian  i would shoot it in the face with my sniper rifle and then teabag its dead body. PEACE!\n",

      "Before going any further  I have to admit that I only saw the first episode of this show. If I had the time  I might have considered watching it every week  if only to see how the season played out. However  it was very clear to me from the beginning that Martha Stewart's version of The Apprentice just doesn't fit in. Martha Stewart made a career of being a happy homemaker  a domestic diva of the likes of Oprah Winfrey and Julia Child. It was only since her scandalous legal troubles and subsequent incarceration that her public image began to reflect the true roughness of her character. Sure  she was compelling for a while  and this entire series poses the interesting question of what it means to be a woman in business. Does she have to come off as cold and tough? Shouldn't she?  But the truth was  by the time Stewart came out of prison  her attempts for a public comeback  though certainly warranted  were never going to seize viewers' interest for very long. Perhaps a true comeback would have worked had she returned home peacefully and waited a year or so after her often mocked ankle bracelet was removed. Instead  she frantically dove into overkill with 2 series at once  the other being her syndicated daytime series Martha  much like her old show  but more mainstream  with famous guests like Bette Midler. Of course  even at her peak Stewart was never mainstream  so it's too much to ask that American audiences immediately accept her foray into reality TV. Maybe America wants Stewart to make a comeback on her own rather than be the basis for it.  The show was basically a tired retread of Trump's Apprentice  which still holds my interest  depending on the tasks  the cast  and Trump's firing decisions (often controversial - likely for that reason). The letter bit was certainly not cliché but obnoxious in the least. The fact that Stewart never says  You're fired! - mentioned in the message board on this site - is particularly distressing. Producer Mark Burnett should be admired for dealing with Stewart's jail time honestly while trying to make her a hero  but the truth is that anyone watching can tell that she's basically trying to put on a show of being this nice businesswoman. Again never mainstream  Stewart lacks the agreeability and identifiability of Oprah Winfrey and the admirable  charismatic toughness of Donald Trump. Yes  this can be a gender-biased assessment of her character  but I mean it to be more about the nature of her business.  It comes as no shock that Stewart has been fired  but I wonder if they really always intended it to only last for one season?\n",

      "this is a movie which reminds me of avatar- starring rajesh khanna from the 80's. the issue of parents-kids divide is interesting but was handled in a rather unoriginal manner.. the characters were not developed fully and the kids seemed to go from being extermely loving ( in the first 15mts of the movie) to being totally unconcerned about the parents   this transformation was not credible to say the least..they sld have explored this a little more. amitabh and jaya were miscast as this helpless old couple.. firstly amit was not too convincing in this role because he just did not look like he should be helpless  i mean why not just go back to work where he is wanted instead of being w/ kids who didnt want them.. hema was not convincing as a 60 yr old either... she didnt look a day over 50.. then the whole isssue of the book baghban winning the booker prize begged credibility.. all in all  a movie that handles an important issue but cld have been made better  i give it 5/10\n",

      "If  like me  you actively seek out the rarest and weirdest (and often most awful) that world cinema has to offer  then you should look no further than the supernatural horror output of Hong Kong in the early 80s. Often mixing bizarre black magic with kung fu and silly comedy  and usually packed with plenty of creepy crawlies (snakes  worms  eels  centipedes etc.)  these movies are about as bizarre as it gets.  Succubare is definitely a case in point: featuring a mountain tribe whose women keep their men from straying by casting nasty spells over them (that  should they leave  cause them to fill up with writhing creatures and die an agonising death)  some so-so martial arts  and lots of real life animal killing (much of which is perpetrated by a geek who has absolutely no bearing on the story)  this film is just plain strange.  A prolonged scene in which the tribeswomen hunt for snakes and insects  casually throwing the creatures into the baskets on their backs  is quite fascinating; a tribal feast that sees a poor ox bashed on the head and then torn apart is totally disgusting; and the moments that show worms crawling in open wounds and being vomited onto the floor will have the squeamish losing their appetite for a while.  However  it's the live animal munching that really qualifies Succubare for legendary status amongst fans of out-there movie-making. It's thoroughly vile to watch and yet strangely compelling: the geek chomps on a snake  woofs down a fat  juicy toad (nasty!)  and hungrily devours a mouse (biting off its head and then shoving the rest in afterwards).  Not a great movie (hell  it's not really even a mediocre movie)  Succubare is recommended only to people who think they've seen it all. This one gets 4 out of 10 from me  which is probably more than it deserves  but I begrudgingly respect it for being able to make me feel slightly ill.\n",

Sammy  the lone black character  must be Mimi's husband in real life because he appears in her other films  but he has zero acting ability.

      "Now  I am going to do this without putting spoilers if I can. My cousin and I were renting movies the other weekend  and we stumbled across this  with the big freaking' scarecrow on the cover. It looked cool  so we rented it alongside Kungfu Hustle.  Wow... Just... Wow.  To start off  the movie was horrible. Now  the box art  opening scenes  and music was decent-to-well done  but the movie itself is horrendous. The acting is sub-par (Sean  the lead  shows hardly any emotion and/or effort in his character)  the scarecrows look nothing like the one on the cover (False advertising  perhaps?)  and the camera shots and angles were that of a bad wrestling event.  And trust me  I'm a wrestling fan. I KNOW bad camera angles. And honestly  this is right up there with Gigli and Pootie Tang. It's done so bad that it AMUSES me. It makes me laugh. So  somehow  this movie takes its place as a good comedy to me.  But  to be fair  it does serve as a what to do and what not to do in movies  especially of the slasher genre.

      "It's difficult to criticize a movie with the title like 'Deathbed: The Bed that Eats' and involves a ghost narrator who's trapped behind a 2-way painting he drew and a bed that snores and  if I'm not mistaken  masturbates. (Now  that's getting back at its human companions!) Furthermore  it foams up (in orange  for whatever reason) to absorb edibles lying on its surface  including apples  wine  fried chicken and  of course  people. Again it's suffice to say  that don't expect too much when you see what I guess is stomach acid  the final remains of anything that orange suds takes  dissolving only certain things. It'll drink the wine  but the bottle's okay and it'll eat away at the chicken bone  but the bucket's just fine. Heck  the bed even replaces the unused containers. Hilariously  at one point it downs Pepto-Bismol. I had to laugh at that one. I don't think they really wanted you to take any of this seriously. It's low budget  and it's extremely easy to see where they cut costs and saved oodles amounts of money. I thought  in a world where there can be a killer 'Lift' and a 'Blood Beach ' this 'Deathbed' might be amusing to watch. For reasons that might involve cost  90% of the film is voice-over  no one screams or shows extremely low signs of fright/confusion on why a bed would attack (I can think of one  and I never was one of those kids that jumped on the bed) and you'll have to suspend your disbelief beyond belief. (A victim loses all flesh on his hands  barely saying ow.) Only one scene  that went on too long  was minutely tense  a woman attempts to crawl away only to be dragged back  using a sheet.

From the lifeless acting to the low budget sets the show reeks of cheapness like last week's Chinese takeout left to simmer in your overheated car.  The show revolves around a pretty  perky  and supposed to be funny girl named Carly  as she and her friends make a live web show called iCarly. Carly lives alone with her older brother who seriously needs some counseling or something  because he's a few cells short of a brain.  The plots of the shows are highly ludicrous and unbearably annoying. But having to watch Carly and her friend  Sam  do their little iCarly show-within-in-a-show is even worse. They basically show weird pictures and stick things up their nose as the laugh-track plays over and over. I mean seriously  every two seconds the laugh track seems to come on for no reason.  So  what's the point of this review? you may ask. Just to ridicule iCarly? Well  yeah  but I'm also warning you to beware of this show.

Peter Dinklage (Barsinister) also did fine  for what trash was given to him. He acted the part shockingly well. And so did Patrick Warburton  the moronic assistant. Now  it was idiotic character but he acted so extremely well  I actually liked the character better than the protagonists. The lines given to him were childish but witty.  However. Alex Neuberger did awful and hope he never acts again. His Scream was so disgustingly fake. Silence. Silence. aaahhhhhhh. In the scene where he hears the dog talk  an oh no  impossible! would have sufficed in place of the pathetic fake scream.  And then there was the girl and her female dog that chased Patrick's character Cad on the roof. At first this makes sense  she's a Reporter. A school reporter but still an inquiring mind regardless. But why  WHY the HELL did she carry her dog around? That was worthless and the damn dog didn't even say anything other than a heartless oh  underdog! Her presence was extremely unnecessary.  Overall  the script was pathetic. The only reason I give this movie a 3 is Barsinister  his assistance  and underdog's voice.\n",

The entire show is a sequence of short monologues or scenes performed on a set that looks like a closet with a bunch of circuit boards taped to the wall. There is very little continuity between scenes  and no plot. A typical scene revolves around some lame joke or special effect and is only a minute or so long. The dialog makes little sense and the special effects look like Photoshop filters. The actors are all adults  but I have literally seen high-school plays with better writing and sets.

And the fact that screenwriters don't break these rules maintains the integrity of the characters. With a completely unnecessary plot twist  the integrity of both Ocean films plummets somewhere between Airplane 2 and a Roadrunner cartoon.  Imagine what would happen  while teetering on the rope bridge outside of the Temple of Doom  if Indy told Shorty and Willie not to worry because throughout the entire first two movies he's secretly had super powers and can fly them both to safety.  Entertaining? Sure  for a Roadrunner cartoon. But Spielberg would never have done that because it would have destroyed the integrity of the film. More importantly  it would have ANGERED the audience. They'd already sat on the edge of their seats through 3 hours worth of Indiana Jones movies and they were counting on Indiana to get them off that bridge in a believable way. If he were to fly off? People would have walked out of the theaters the same way people did during Ocean's 12.  SPOILERS  1. Julia Roberts'character  Tess  infiltrates a museum by disguising herself as...Julia Roberts?!?

I expected something at least slightly epic  with the historical fiction and the romance concurring to thrill you; that's what they did in Last of the Mohicans for example  and I think they did a superb job. Maybe I had standards too high for this movie and didn't give it a fair chance.

Nouvelle-France is a love story set in an eventful historical age. But the history of Nouvelle-France is hardly a side note  and the love story is banal and fails dramatically to make the viewer care for the lovers' fate. Surprisingly  the only good parts about the movie came from something completely unexpected and unadvertised: the relationship between Marie-Loup  the heroine  and her children (one natural  one adopted). If only they'd concentrated on her family and forgotten about the love story  it would have been a much better movie. Marie-Loup's parents should have been given more screen time and character development  the politics going on in Britain should have been more than a three-minute scene with barely any connection to the rest  the rotten baddie should have been either more developed or removed from the script completely (why hire actors like Vincent Perez  Tim Roth or Jason Isaacs to misuse them so badly?)

      "First I must confess that A Separate Peace is my favorite book. So of course  I have some bias against any attempt at adapting it for a feature film or television movie. But as I began to watch this film  I was more than willing to give it the benefit of the doubt. The original version from the early 1970s  though shot at Phillips Exeter Academy where the book's author attended school  and though it stayed as faithful as it could to the book  lacked any real depth of feeling and failed to capture the essence of the characters. The original seemed to simply go through the motions. Reading the trivia about the movie  you discover that it was cast mostly with non-actors. Thus  the original has an amateurish feel to it and it ultimately fails.  This new version  though I will grant that it captures the look of the period better than the original  seems to have thrown the book out all together. Scenes are rearranged  characters imposed where they don't belong  characters created that were not in the book  and no attempt was made to delve into the deeper conflicts that make the book so compelling. And the cardinal sin of all: the tree is not treated as the vital  almost central character it is in the book. This is an inexcusable oversight on the part of the film makers. How could they downplay the role of the tree? Why was it not introduced immediately? Why the Dead Poet-esque beginning? And what in God's name was up with Gene's accent? This film is  to be blunt  garbage. A Separate Peace should not be a difficult book to adapt for the stage or screen. John Knowles wrote it in a perfectly fine  linear style. The film makers should have trusted the story as it was already written; make changes  sure; embellish here and there  sure; take some mild dramatic license  sure. But destroy one of the pearls of American literature in the process? What were they thinking? In their corruption of the story line  they cut any possibility of suspense or drama. The whole movie falls flat and fails miserably.  If you are a high school or college student assigned to read this book and you are thinking of skimping and just watching the movie...don't even think about it. This film will be of no help to you.

      "What a ridiculous waste of time and money!!!! This movie was the biggest loser of the year. All the hype was a warning. I am disappointed for Julia Roberts  by far she is the most talented cast member. I think her ability to truly act carried the film. The buddy buddy boys club was a little too phony  and to add insult to injury why bother to cast Catherine Zeta Jones? She only has the ability to ruin a film. She lacks the ability to have on screen chemistry with anyone  not to mention she lacks the ability to act. She lacks chemistry with the other characters: kind of reminiscent of America's Sweetheart's. She made The Terminal terminal. This movie is headed nowhere  what a shame  please please don't tell me 13 is on the way!\n",

      "We screened this movie in a club as an example of how classic literature can become twisted into some of the most awful movies of all time. Just the fact that the back of the box proudly proclaimed the plot to be set in the techno-futile future should have been enough of a hint. I think that word describes the movie itself  because no matter how much technology they tried to use to save this movie  the effort was completely futile. Not to mention that our club advisor told us that it allegedly couldn't get a distributor for two years.  This cinematic failure is littered with cheesy  cliche dialogue that's worse than angsty teen poetry. Beowulf's character changes halfway through in a way that is in no way credible  and whenever he's in an action scene  he's constantly flipping like a hyper gymnast. There is even  as they say  a token black guy whose attempts at humor are completely out of place. And  of course  the daughter of the leader of the outpost Grendel is terrorizing is a total vixen. A vixen whose breasts are exposed throughout the entire movie. A vixen who wants to fight the creature  yet she never puts on armor. And her weapon of choice is a little carving knife. And despite their dire situation  she still dresses up for dinner  in a dress with a see-through skirt that exposes her short-shorts underwear. There are a couple scenes that could pass as soft core pornography  and in the second scene they even reuse footage from the first. I thought the portrayal of Grendel was bad enough  but then came the end of the film  which featured a display of CGI that might be decent for the 80s  but is totally ridiculous for a late 90s venture. I could go on  but you all should watch this film for the fully laughable effect yourselves.  The other club members and I did manage to have fun watching this by taking a cue from MST 3K and mocking it the whole way through. I'm still reeling from an extra's weapon: a perpetually spinning pizza cutter on a pole.\n",

      "I think I win the bargain contest for this movie  since I got it as part of a Martial Arts Movie Classics DVD collection with 50 movies for 20 bucks  which means I paid something like 50 cents for the chance to watch the Black Fist version of a movie that was released as Bogard.   For a basic revenge flick  Black Fist isn't too bad  even though it is obviously hampered by a low budget. One of my informal rules of thumb for watching a movie is that if the lead actor is better than his production and screenplay  the movie automatically gets at least three stars. That is certainly the case here; Lawson has some presence and some charisma  and probably deserved a better film career than he got.   The street fight choreography (the ostensible reason for the film) really won't to impress anyone who has ever sparred in a martial arts school or even just been punched in a schoolyard fight. I only spent about two years learning basic kung fu  but even I would never fall for the front stamp kicks  arm drags  and roundhouse punches on display here. But the atmosphere is good - dust and blood and shouting crowds  and the actors put some feeling into the fight scenes.   Less believable is the plot. Dawson's character Leroy Fisk  is portrayed as a street-smart  sharp young man who goes looking for work as a pick-up fighter in illegal  unsanctioned street matches. Yet he is surprised and indignant when he has to pay off the cops? Excuse me  but I was raised in small town Iowa and even *I* knew (from watching Hard Times with Charles Bronson) that the cops have to be paid off for this sort of action  and that the guys who fight needed the fixers in order to get their matches  and that the fixers were worth the money. So you have to watch this movie with a sort of willful suspension of your critical faculties in order to accept it as a black brother being repressed movie. (Most of the other non-black fighters in the stable get punched in the face for the same deal too yes?).  The movie suffers from a short attention span. The director obviously didn't have the budget to film some of the scenes he needed  so he had to fill in the gaps with some fairly ludicrous exposition scenes (The I wined him  I dined him  and then I killed him scene just doesn't work) along with voice-overs and montages that are clumsy and unconvincing. This is especially true with the whole romance angle which seems to have been filmed as if it were an afterthought. This is a little shoddy when you consider that the death of Fisk's wife's death is supposed to fuel his drive for revenge.  But  once the movie switches all the way from young fighter rising through the ranks to the revenge theme  it picks up a little steam and plays with a little more conviction. I'm not sure that the final payoff is worth the buildup - Roger Ebert calls this sort of thing a long drive for a short day at the beach..but it does tie things off in a reasonably satisfying way.   If Sylvester Stallone had made this film with a real budget and the same cast  slicker sets and costumes  and himself as the hero  people would have hailed it as the next Rocky  which goes to show you how circumstance and chance can play havoc with would-be filmmakers' dreams.   Worth seeing once for various decent shots and lines and to watch Dabney Coleman embarrass himself in a role that is beneath him.\n",

      "Witchcraft/Witchery/La Casa 4/ and whatever else you wish to call it. How about..Crud.  A gathering of people at a Massachusetts island resort are besieged by the black magic powers of an evil witch killing each individual using cruel  torturous methods. Photographer Gary(David Hasselhoff)is taking pictures for Linda(Catherine Hickland whose voice and demeanor resemble EE-YOR of the Winnie the Poo cartoon)  a virgin studying witchcraft  on the island resort without permission. Rose Brooks(Annie Ross  portraying an incredibly rude bitch)is interested in perhaps purchasing the resort and  along with husband Freddie(Robert Champagne  who is always ogling other women much younger than him)  pregnant daughter Jane(Linda Blair)and grandson Tommy(Michael Manchester  who just looks bored throughout  probably wanting to watch Sesame Street instead of starring in this rubbish)  go by boat to the resort being treated to a look at the property by Realtor Tony Giordano's son Jerry(Rick Farnsworth)  obviously a pup in the business getting his feet wet. Along with these folks is architect Leslie(Leslie Cumming  whose character is a nympho)who might help Rose re-design the resort. The boat's captain is killed by The Lady in Black(Hildegard Knef  wearing her make-up and lip-stick extra thick)and a storm is brewing. The boat drives off by itself(..guided by the invisible power of The Lady in Black  I guess)with everyone stuck in the decrepit resort  which is in dire need of repairs. Most of the victims  before meeting their grisly fates are carried through a type of red wormhole whose vortex leads to another dimension(..perhaps a type of hell or something)where they are tortured by these fiends dressed in raggedy clothes with a crummy visage. One victim has her mouth sown before being hung upside down in a chimney  roasted as the others light the fireplace. One poor soul is tortured by harsh twistings of rope wrapped tightly around her flesh before being found hanging from the snout of a swordfish penetrating through her neck. One fellow is slowly suffocating as his veins bulge(..and bleed) and neck's blood vessels burst squirting in Hasselhoff's face! One fellow is crucified with nails hammered into his hands before being hung upside down over an open flame. Blair's pregnant victim becomes possessed with her hair standing on end speaking in another woman's voice. One is raped by this demonic man with a diseased mouth as the hellish hobos stand nearby gleefully cheering. The film  despite it's excesses  is mostly dull fodder for those who really wish to see the lowest point in the careers of Hasselhoff and Blair  who deserve better than this. Almost unbearable at times  building little-to-no suspense. Clumsy execution of the death sequences which look cheap and laughable. Sure some gore is okay  but most of the film shows victims after they've been run through the ringer. We do get a chance to see pregnant women(..who look exactly like stuntmen in costume with bad wigs) jumping out three story windows. Oh  and The Lady in Black's reflected face often pops up on inanimate objects for characters to see. Tommy has a little Sesame Street recorder which tapes The Lady in Black's mumbo jumbo chants  obviously used for later. For some reason  The Lady in Black likes to visit little Tommy. He's not at all scared of her  for Tommy's just too bored to show any expression on his face  much less fear. Need I say more? This one's a real stinker. Ugh.\n",

      "As many know  this is the feature film debut of Edward D. Wood Jr. as as a writer/producer/director/actor. I have been a fan of Ed Wood for several years now. While I don't like this as much as some of his other films it was probably the largest insight that the cinematic going public gets of Wood during his life. Everybody knows that he was a transvestite. This film is about changing one's sex and how being a transvestite can create conflict in relationships with loved ones. This film is way ahead of its time in dealing with this subject matter and how it deals with it. However  the film still contains Wood's usual pitfalls of bad dialog  meaningless stock footage  and hokey special effects. Throw in Wood's usual overdose of Bela Lugosi hamming it up and you have Wood's first attempt at being a director.  The plot is that a police inspector goes to a doctor after he discovers the body of a transvestite who committed suicide for advice on how to avoid further problems along these lines. The doctor tells him the story of Glen  who is also a transvestite. Glen wants to marry Barbara  but can't bring himself to tell her about his secret. He also tells the inspector about Alan who undergoes a sex change because he is really more suited to being a woman. Bela Lugosi plays a scientist who seems to add some kind of running commentary on what is going on (Lugosi's part really isn't well defined and proves to be most likely a vehicle for Wood to have a star in his film and Lugosi to get some cash).  All in all  the movie shows the hallmarks of Wood's career. It was obviously shot on a very low budget and has quite a few things thrown in rather haphazardly. It definitely has the it's so bad  it's good feel to it. However  I do have to applaud Ed on his progressive thinking in making this film. Transvestitism and sex changes were not extremely open subjects in the early 50s. Wood took a big risk in making a film that portrays transvestites as people who are not sexual deviants and putting a more human face on cross-dressing.\n",

      "Its difficult to be too tough on Brad Sykes  a hard-working guy doing what he loves  there is an honesty about him that seems often lacking with other microbudget directors. Check out the minuscule crew credits on Camp Blood  there is none of the usual thanking everyone down to the pizza joint they ate in  its Brad and his buddies and thats it  no pretentious rubbish. Jennifer Ritchkoff isn't your average horror flick heroine  but does well enough for you to hardly notice  Bethany Zolt looks like a star and Joseph Haggerty is so funny it hurts. The Clown is hardly an original horror film bad guy  but the design is good  Shemp Moseley does a decent job of bringing him to life and the image clashes nicely with the rural backdrop. Camp Blood is horror as blue collar and basic as it gets  not a good thing  not a bad thing  just a thing.\n",

      "Having first read the novel  I don't mind for the purposes of filming  how differently it is scripted  as long as it adheres to  or at least includes  the plot. For reasons known only to Hollywood  important parts of the story are completely ignored  and a different story line added. The reason this novel passed the test of time  is  no doubt  due to the interweaving of both the characters  and plot  as a whole. To interfere with this structure  is to destroy the intricate balance of the story line  and therefore the intension of the story teller. Although a matter of opinion  the casting of this film leaves a lot to be desired. Characters  described as very fat  should  at least  be made to look portly  to allow for the character to have credibility. The days of slavery can't be over  or surely  actors of this calibre would have been in revolt  at such a travesty of the story. The face of Marian Halcolme is described as being manly in appearance ... Tara Fitzgerald's very feminine appearance doesn't ring true. Again Laura Fairly is described as being 'fair'  if not 'ethereal'  so  with dark hair  she does not quite fit the impression gleaned from the novel. ....Badly done  Hollywood!  J. Hunter\n",

      "This movie just happened to be on HBO yesterday so I watched it. This was a mistake. I guess I got sucked in and kept watching although it was a lot like a train wreck  terrible  horrible  but somehow you just can't look away. shaudenfraud I guess! ; ).  This is the story of a photoshoot for models on some island in the Caribbean. One by one they are all murdered. One drinks cleaning fluid  one gets blown up on a waverunner  one goes over a cliff...so these are NOT accidents  but for some inane reason the police are never called and no one thinks that perhaps they should wrap the shoot and go home  not just in respect for the dead  but perhaps out of fear for their own lives. No. They just continue with their shoot because THAT is what's most important. Forget about the dead models  we have a magazine to produce!  One of the subplots is the Evil magazine owner  played by Lee Majors  Rex is his name. He is the most obvious suspect and every time a model gets killed he twirls his mustache and says well  I can't say this won't be good for sales  mooo hoo hoo hoo ha ha ha ha. So absurd. Another subplot is when it's revealed that Rex is one of the models baby dady  only when he learned of the baby he tried to convince the girl to abort. She didn't  but always resented him for even suggesting this.  They try to give you false clues and point toward some guy named Raule  seemingly because he's the only one with an accent and looks creepy.  At the very end (sorry to spoil  but this movie came out years ago so if you haven't seen it by now...) one of the women was found face down dead in the pool. THIS was the Last straw!!!! Vanessa Angel  forget her characters name comes at Rex with a gun  they struggle  the gun fires and now SHE'S dead too!!! While she's laying on the floor his business associate tells him that with all this bad press the magazine will be worthless and it's all his fault. He gets him to sign over the magazine to him. Once he does voila! All the dead models come back to life and you find the entire thing was an elaborate ruse to get back at Rex.  Oy! What a ridiculous movie.

      "Leslie Nielsen is usually someone whose movies I really like (even critically panned flicks like Dracula: Dead and Loving It and Wrongfully Accused). So the fact that I'm slamming Mr. Magoo should show that it's a piece of junk. It casts Nielsen as the myopic title character  something gets planted on him  and he makes a mess of everything. It seems like the combo of Nielsen and director Stanley Tong (behind two of Jackie Chan's movies) would make this one hilarious movie  but it doesn't; it seems like they just have people to do anything  and there's no real humor here.  So  the original cartoon with Jim Backus providing the voice was worth seeing  so avoid this movie. Leslie Nielsen has also done much better  so there's no reason to waste your time on this.

I wouldn't even call it a movie. A better description might be a record of a few chamber concert pieces. As I recall  the camera never even moved. Rather  I just sat on a tripod for the entirety of each piece. The only attempts at dramatic effect were at the very end of each piece when the movie would cut to trees waving in the wind or little wavelets lapping at a beach. I'm sure the director would have preferred to have used footage of some really big crashing waves but the best he could find were a few inches high at some nearby lake  and again using a stationary camera. Truly pathetic. I can't imagine how anyone could justify rating this movie higher than a five. When we walked out  my father and I were completely mystified as to how it was possible to make such a bad movie. I don't know of of any good movies about Bach.

My question is how in the world did they let this script out of the drafting process? I thought that not only did the plot develop like a slug racing to the end of the sidewalk  but that twist? (can i call it that) was so incredibly stupid that i wanted to go demand a refund from the ticket booth. I have never felt so played and used from a movie in my entire life.

The part that gets me still is that this movie has now grossed more than 125 million dollars.  In summary  I felt that this movie insulted my intelligence.

Evidently based on some actual incidents during WWII  the film just doesn't connect with the viewer for some reason that it is not quite clear to me. One very likely reason is that - in the print I saw on TCM  anyway - none of the scenes where the Germans talked among themselves were given titles. This interesting directorial concept - to let the non-German speaking viewer just guess from context what the Germans are saying to each other - is  in my book  an utter flop and helps to lock the viewer out. Also  the way the movie begins - just dropping us into a very confused situation without much setup - is disorienting.

It's quite unprofessional  and adds nothing. It's really just a sad attempt at making an achingly unfunny movie seem somewhat witty.  However  if you're able to look past all of this and suspend a lot of disbelief  you might be entertained by the adequate storyline.  I voted 4/10.\n",

      "As someone who has read all of Baroness Orczy's books and seen most of the movies based on them  I must say that the 1980's version  with Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour  was better than this. It was better written and stuck more to the spirit of the story than this one  which seemed to go out of its way to involve people getting shot. This new adaptation is less light-hearted  yet does not have as much depth  either. Although there is some good acting  the actors did not have much to work with. Nice costumes  though.\n",

      "Ill-conceived sequel(..the absurd idea of having the killer snowman on the rampage at an island resort where there is no snow or cold weather)brings back the spirit of the psychopath  returning thanks to a scientific experiment providing foreign elements which reintroduce life to his molecules(..it's the best I could do to explain this preposterous concept).  I could go into depth about how he winds up at the island in order to slay numerous tourists  but I simply find no reason to bother because it'd all be so exhausting. Anyway  the filmmakers think it wise to kill off the pretty girls not ten minutes after their arrival(..I mean seriously  why worry with even introducing them to us if we can't enjoy our eye candy no longer that this?!).  The snow anvil murder scene takes the cake. Ice icicles protrude from the beach's sand so that a victim can fall on them. Oh  and another girl is stabbed with a pair of weenie tongs.  Look I get what's coming to me when I sit down to watch a killer snowman movie..such a ridiculous supernatural slasher will either tickle your funnybone(Oh  it's such a wonderfully cheesy horror movie!)or have you pondering why the hell you're wasting time with such nonsense. Jack Frost has the power to freeze water(..then how were they able to melt him in the first film?)and causes the island resort to snow. One sequence has Jack freezing pool water  encasing a swimming model under the sheet  result being her drowning with nowhere to escape.Oh  there's also a recreation of the tongue stuck to the icy pole bit from The Christmas Story(Cowatonga dude!).  I gotta hand it to the cast  though..they're real troopers for trying to make this wretched material entertaining. Christopher Allport(..perhaps unwisely)returns as Sam  to face his old nemesis  as does Eileen Seeley  as his wife. The attempts at tongue-in-cheek humor(..for me  at least) fell flat  but the cast soldiers onward trying to make the most of a very difficult situation  with spirited performances they do their best to rise above the pitiful premise and woeful dialogue.  A development occurs which increases the danger towards those still around to face off with Jack  his genetically altered water molecules  thanks to the introduced foreign elements  allow him to withstand coolant/anti-freeze  and  even worse  he now can reproduce..through indigestion  Jack hacks up what appear to be snowballs which hatch to reveal little snowballs with black eyes  mouth and sharp teeth! The killer snowman costume and little snowball puppets introduced later in the film might produce belly-laughs if you are in the mood for such shenanigans  but I personally found this junk rather hokey(..that's the purpose behind it  I suppose  cheap guffaws from those willing to embrace this)and unbearable.The snowball offspring is an obvious homage to Gremlins where we get a bar scene where the little bastards are celebrating in number over terrorizing victims at the resort. The weapon against them..bananas! It's explained that when Jack went to kill Sam in the first film  both fell in a truck bed full of anti-freeze(..an icicle emerging from Jack's belly was penetrating Sam's chest when he pushed them out a window into the truck bed  and I guess in their being being linked by the icicle  Jack inherited Sam's banana allergy  or so this is what we are led to believe!)and in doing so both merged in a sense.  Phew  such a film as this defies simple explanation. It's a film with effects and plot so terrible  one might find the presentation enjoyable because of it's many failings.\n",

      "In general  I prefer horror movies that creep me out so much I'm afraid of everything for the next day or so  not the ones where people act stupid and get killed by an indestructible monster. This is one of those movies. The chupacabra of legend is a dog-faced lizard-skin greenish-gray monster that hops like a kangaroo  has fangs and claws  has a row of sharp spines sticking out from its back  and sucks the blood of livestock. As in many horror movies  good and bad  this movie takes liberty with the legend. It not only attacks humans  but it eats their intestines and has a bulletproof  nearly indestructible constitution. So tell me  how can a hypodermic needle penetrate its skin when bullets can't? And why  when the marines figure out that armor-piercing bullets can hurt it  do they split up so the chupacabra can pick them off one by one? John Rhys-Davies gives a performance that rises above the bad movie  and Chelan Simmons and Dylan Neal deserve credit for their performances  too. Otherwise  the rest of the acting was poor to bad  just like the rest of the movie. My rating is based on Rhys-Davies  Simmons and Neal.\n",

      "After the opening credits over a black sheet of paper with spots of white paint sprayed onto it  oh OK I'll be generous and call it a star field  we witness an alien spacecraft crashing into a meteorite and being forced to land on earth. A terrible looking model spacecraft lands on a terrible looking model field. Three nearby campers investigate. From the burning spacecraft a reptile like looking alien  the 'Nightbeast' emerges  OK so I lied it's a guy in a dodgy rubber monster mask and silver spacesuit. The campers are quickly killed by the Nighbeast's laser gun which shoots awful special effects at people. The towns Sheriff Jack Cinder (Tom Griffith) is informed. He alerts his deputy Lisa Kent (Karin Kardian) and gathers a posse of men together to investigate. Meanwhile the Nightbeast has killed an unlucky motorist who stopped on the side of the road for a leak. His two annoying kids run for help. They approach a house  inside two young people are kissing  the girl says someones running towards the house. The guy gets up to take a look and is attacked and gutted by the Nightbeast  it kills the girl as well. Then it manages to kill the two kids with his laser  maybe the Nightbeast ain't so bad after all. Once the Sheriff and his men arrive at the scene they have a gun/laser battle with the Nightbeast. After possibly the most unexciting gun fight in film history only the Sheriff  his deputy and a local man Jamie Lambert (Jamie Zemarel) survive. But the Nightbeast is still alive  bullets seem to have no effect on it. The next day the Sheriff visits the towns Mayor  Bert Wicker (Richard Dyszel) and his girlfriend Mary Jane (Eleanor Herman) to get permission to evacuate everyone in the town. He refuses saying a party he is holding for the Governor (Richard Ruxton) cannot be cancelled  and that he doesn't want to create a panic situation. The Sheriff evacuates the town anyway. Two doctors  Steven Price (George Stover) and Ruth Sherman (Anne Firth) are attacked by the Nightbeast before they can leave. However  they manage to scare the Nightbeast away and survive. Together with the Sheriff his deputy and Jamie they decide to stay behind and fight the alien. Written and directed by Don Dohler this has to be an amateur film  made with family and friends  look at the credits and see how many Dohler's are involved. For that reason I should probably cut it some slack but that still doesn't stop it  or excuse it from being a throughly awful film in every department. It has no story or purpose  things just happen to waste time  whats with Drago (Don Leifert) strangling his ex girlfriend Suzie (Monica Neff)? This and many more scenes add nothing to the film. The script has no logic either  why does the Nightbeast stick around the town once it's been supposedly evacuated? The special effects are embarrassingly bad  just look at the effect when the Nightbeast shoots someone with his laser  a computer effect an 80's spectrum would be ashamed of. There's not really much blood or gore in it  a ripped open stomach  a severed arm and a decapitation but they all look predictably poor. Credit where it's due  the Nightbeast itself looks alright for the most part. There's a sex scene between the Sheriff and his deputy which has to be seen to be believed  music that even a porno would be embarrassed about and two really ugly naked people make this a difficult sequence to watch. Less than stellar acting  photography  music  lighting and editing make it a real chore to sit through. And the worse thing about this film? It commits the mortal sin of being boring and not fun in the slightest. Sorry Don mate  but don't give up the day job! Definitely one to avoid.\n",

      "I was duped into watching this by the many friendly reviews here. Boy  are they way off mark! To give this 9 to 10 points and call it one of the best movies of the 1990ies is just unjustifiable. The big problem here is lack of pace and a paper-thin plot. It's like slapstick on Prozac. Everything trundles along predictably and listlessly. The plot is weak to begin with -- two garbage men peep on their foxy neighbour  witness a murder and unravel a waste disposal conspiracy -- and the movie never manages to go much further. There are some amusing situations and decent acting  but that's not anywhere near enough to save this jalopy of a movie.  It's simply a comedy that doesn't get its fat ass off the ground  so why waste your time?\n",

Until I saw Rollerball  this was my pick for worst film ever from a major studio with a real budget (claiming Mangler 2 or Leprechaun in the Hood as the worst ever isn't really saying much  those are supposed to be bad)  Tim Curry's mom must have needed surgery or something for him to agree to this non-sensical garbage. I'm really not sure what happened here. The novel was great  the director Frank Marshall had a solid track record with Alive and Arachnophobia (perhaps they should have changed the title to 'Africa')  the cast was good and the budget was there.

      "I am a huge fan of the Farcry Game  HUGE fan. It still holds a place in my top-10 games list of all time! The story line was new  fresh... A truly brilliant foundation to base a movie on... or so i thought...  Farcry the Movie is no less than another directors attempt at cashing in on a successful game franchise (see Doom: The Movie  and many more...).  The Video Game begins as the player (Jack Carver) awakes in a sea side cave after been shot off his boat by an RPG from an unknown soldier. Jack then finds a communication device where (Harlan Doyle) guides him across islands  shipwrecks  jungles  installations and VOLCANOES  to find his (lady friend?) (Valerie Constantine)  all the wile battling mutated super soldiers  and genetically enhanced animals.  The Movie plays out very  very differently: 1: There's a needless 30 mins (1/3 of the movie) of backstory before we even get to the 'boat blowing up' scene. 2: Jack then walks onto the beach  kills some goons  then drives off... Nothing like the game... 3: There is no communicator with Doyle on the other end... 4: The 'Modified Soldiers' look like albinos with singlets on... And there was no mutated 'monkey-like' creatures jumping out of the bushes. A part of the Farcry game i enjoyed allot... 5: There is no sun filled beach scenes  no aircraft carrier  no communications stations on huge cliffs  LITTLE reference to any in-game contents (characters/items/vehicles)  in fact no attempt to follow the story line at all. 6: The climactic Volcano scene from the game is replaced with an old industrial building. 7: There's an Ending scene... where everyone (except Krieger) live happily ever after... WHAT THE!  I recommend avoiding this movie at all costs! If you are a Gamer  you will HATE this movie will all your soul. It is a movie clearly intended for males  so girls  stay away... So if your a male  12-29 years of age  have never played Farcry  and are not disgusted by directors attempts at porting books/games to the cinema... then this is for you...\n",

      "...and that's a goddamn shame! Please make the sun rise and have it incinerate all copies of Dracula 3000. This must be the WORST vampire-flick of the new millennium so far (I haven't seen REIGN IN DARKNESS yet  but they don't get much worse than this). Don't be fooled be the movie's cool H.R. Gigeresque cover. This is so bad  it's almost hilarious. I can't describe all the emotions this movie conjured. I laughed my ass off  I yelled at the screen  I sat there numb  nodding my head in disbelief ... This film has 'cheap & cheese' written all over it. The best thing of this movie are the opening-credits and the opening-shots which feature more or less okay CGI of two space-ships. But when Casper Van Dien's voice-over comes on  you start smelling something fishy. And  indeed  it all goes downhill rapidly after that.  The crew of a salvage-spaceship finds an abandoned vessel  the Demeter  which seems to be heading for earth. They enter it  thus sealing their fate. This movie is  above all things  a shameless low-budget ALIEN-rip-off  mixed with vampires. Right down to the plot-twist were Erika Eleniak's character  Aurora  reveals she's a robot. Coolio goes badly over-the-top as the dope-smoking  bloodsucking 187 (pffff  code from the hood as a name?!?!). Casper Van Dien's character's named Capt. Van Helsing (hahaha!) and he looks like... er well  Casper Van Dien. Udo Kier as Capt. Varna  former commander of the Demeter  is only shown on a monitor-screen and he really does seem to have trouble reading his lines from an auto-cue (poor Udo  what where you doing in this flick?). And then we have Langley Kirkwood as count Orlock  one of the most pathetic and laughable Dracula's ever to (dis)grace the silver screen. Just look at his outfit. Instead of some cool-looking futuristic black suit or something  he's wearing a cheap old-school Halloween-suit with fringes. You thought Richard Roxburgh was unconvincing as Dracula in VAN HELSING? Then wait until you see Langley's performance!  The set-designers went overboard on this one. The interior of the Demeter looks like a cross between an oil-tanker and an old steel-factory  which they decorated with awful lights and colors like green  pink  blue and yellow. The prop-master must have forgotten that this movie takes place in the year 3000  because the characters use guns which look like today's .45 magnums and Prof uses a non-motorized  non-floating wheelchair. It has to be pushed around in order to move.  Aside from one dried-up corpse  a few impalements and one dismemberment there's absolutely no gore. And the vampire-fangs and contact-lenses look fake as hell. Add to that also the most lame  stupid and abrupt ending ever: Humvee and Aurora are the only survivors. Instead of having one final (bloody) showdown with count Orlock  they lock themselves in the control-room. Then Aurora explains that before her program was upgraded and joining narcotics  she used to be a Protheus 3.2 PB  in other words: a pleasure-bot. So she says Well then  what are you waiting for. Humvee answers Ain't gotta tell me twice. Come on  girl  picks her up and... BOOOOOOM!!! the ship explodes and credits roll. No sex-scene  no Erika flashin' her boobies  no bloody climax ... Just one more shot of Udo Kier reading a line on the monitor and it's over.  So  this movie is a must-see for every bad-movie-lover  but I must warn them: It gets really painful at times. And everyone claiming that VAN HELSING  UNDERWORLD or even QUEEN OF THE DAMNED is the worst vampire-movie of the new millennium clearly is insane  or just hasn't seen Dracula 3000 yet.\n",

      "So many fans  so little to show for it. I know  I know  these words are gonna find me in a great minority. A lot of people really liked Good Will Hunting. But seriously please  great film making  not even close  and let's put the blame where it belongs... in the writing.  Now  I know they won an oscar for it  and boy did they look good emoting on the screen. But Good Will Hunting is an ABC after school special with lots of cursing in it  and a slightly bigger budget.  What this movie does show  is the brilliance of Harvey Weinstein and Miramax Pictures. Mr. Weinstein could take manure  feed it to you  and make you believe your eating bon bons. And that's exactly what the studio did with the film. They created such high faluttin buzz around it  that people believed  and wanted to believe it so much --- that they saw brilliance where there was none.  Now  I know some people think it's a great movie  I don't think it's a horribly bad movie  I like to compare it to more in the middle of the road movies  and also to some great Made for TV movies (although  not HBO films  HBO films are unusually better than Good Will Hunting would ever be.) It's just a nice  little film  with some good performances  Robin Williams was not good in it  they just gave him the oscar cause the'd been itching to do it for a while. And of course  the Miramax public relations machine secured Ben and Matt their screenwriting oscar... but come one people... there's better movies out there thatn GWH.\n",

She being the best thing in this movie. The Wilder gags were flat and frankly more like something a freshman in college would write trying to get away w/being wicked witty and dirty  but just sounded boring and not funny at all. It seemed the humor was being pushed too hard to be funny. The ending was totally contrived.

Don't even get me started on the obnoxious theme music.  On top of all that the show is out of touch with U.S. audiences due to the heavy Canadian references all throughout it. Oh say Derek  will you be going to Queens College in the Fall! How have you bean? We should go oot.   Granted  other shows are filmed in Canada for financial reasons like Stargate: Atlantis  but while those shows may have suffered from some annoyances (like Rodney calling a Z-P-M a Zed-P-M) the show didn't focus on life in Canada.  MTV is running Degrassi (another show based on the experiences of the Canadian teenager) during daytime hours when no one is watching to fill time (most teens are at school when it airs). I'd wager it's for the same reason. Shows that focus on teenage life in Canada don't translate well to a U.S. audience.

      "Quite liked Flesh and looking forward to Heat but couldn't help but feel Morrissey grossly exploited most of the performers featured here. Stumbling around naked in a narcotic stupor seems to be all Dallesandro was capable of in this feature--a huge and heartbreaking contrast from Flesh. His semi-erection in a few scenes is the only indication that he might be acting; mostly it looks like something he did to buy drugs. Woodlawn is a revelation all right--she is the embodiment of the Lower East Side. But hers is a one woman show--she rarely engages the other performers though  it has to be said  her sex scene with a beer bottle definitely leaves Halle Berry in the shade when it comes to cinematic displays of raw passion. When she pounces on a young  would-be lover it is with the ferocity of a vampire. Two of the female performers  Andrea and Jane  have such annoying voices you'll have to mute the sound to get through their scenes. The fact that several of these performers committed suicide or were murdered a few years after only adds to the air of exploitation. But they were probably desperate to get in front of Morrissey's camera anyway. There probably isn't a worse way to spend a Saturday night but at least it brings a specific time and place vividly to life.\n",

      "The trailer for this film promised a new twist on the zombie genre: setting it in the Old West. Except it's not the real Old West  of course. It's some sort of Future West  in a world where some apocalypse has  as apocalypses are known to do  killed people and subsequently turned them into zombies. It's zombie virus time again  folks  and you know what that means? Get bitten and become one of them.  So  into this dusty and dead-filled world comes a hero. He's a bounty-hunter  getting paid for taking care of zombies. It's not exactly clear who is providing the funds  but it seems a little cottage industry of zombie-hunting has emerged. But  as the trailer tells us  there's a problem. They are running out of zombies. The only way to keep on earning is to infect new towns and cities with the virus.  I think that's not a bad idea for a film. But unfortunately it takes a lot more than a good idea and a crowd of people pawing at windows to make a good zombie film. What we actually get is a Clint Eastwood clone (the actor's even called Clint  for crying out loud) and his hilarious sidekick  trying to bag zombies while trailing some still-living bad guys to get some big reward. The whole subplot about infecting other towns is only mentioned in passing  over half-way through the film. Instead  there's a lot of western movie clichés  poor zombie make-up and some world-class bad acting. Really bad. The sort that wouldn't even make it onto Hollyoaks. Both hero and villain chomp on cigars  quips are thrown  people get bitten. As the movie lurches to a conclusion  the only thing worth wondering is whether it's going to end with the cliché of the hero being the only man alive  having killed the one he loves  or the cliché of him turning into a zombie in the final frame. (It's the first one  by the way) This film was written and directed by Gerald Nott. It's the only thing he has done and  hopefully  it will be his last. At the start of the film there is a caption that reads Nott Entertainment. At least they got one thing right.\n",

      "I can name only a few movies that I have seen which were this bad. This movie has terrible everything: The dialog is corny and cliché'  the acting is poor for the most part with a few exceptions  the cinematography is nothing to cheer about  and the plot is silly (A fat woman stalks a suburban family because her daughter didn't make the soccer team). This is so bad  it's funny to watch. If you can catch this on lifetime  I'd recommend it highly as a comedy. As for being a serious movie  I'm afraid i'll have to rate this a 2.  Don't watch this film if you are a serious movie fan and looking for an interesting and challenging storyline  or good acting. There is none to be found.  Edit: Hmmm... I think a group of people who work for lifetime must have written some phony reviews and voted all the negative ones down. Don't believe them. This is a really crappy movie.\n",

      "All those who are into the PC culture are aghast at the dogmatic Christian view of this film  claiming it contains racist ideation and/or religious intolerance.  Those who don't care about this  but are oriented towards slick production values and competent acting are dismayed at the lack of such here.  Those who decry both of these are apoplectic that this production was let loose on the general public  as evidenced in comments here.  What is an interesting premise  which isn't original  but is a combination of GHOST and FROM BEYOND  is dealt with in a rather immature manner in this film  yet done with gusto. What the crew and actors lacked in sensibility  professional abilities and technical expertise is somewhat offset by the intensity they display.  It isn't nearly as bad as many here think  and would have been fine in the hands of someone with maturity and common sense  and it is enough below mediocrity to elicit laughs and groans. However  it unfolds with enough intensity to keep interest throughout  and is close to on par with a Corman-produced entry of his earliest period of work  or the material of Arkoff or Sam Katzman. If you get it for $2 (or less) as did I  you won't feel disappointed  but will wish you could have had a say in how it was made.\n",

      "I just caught this on Showtime...ewwwwwww  not even fun in a bad movie kind of way. One of the lamest monster flicks I've ever seen. Plus the TV reporter in the movie was that annoying Jerri from a past season of Survivor. The only amusing thing was that the secret base was the house from Fantasy Island (and a million other movies and TV shows; the place is located in the L.A. area). I fully expected Mr Roarke and Tattoo to come out and greet the visitors. If Tattoo had gotten eaten by the snake  I might have given this movie a 2  but oh well. Watching people stand there and scream for five minutes while the Komodo or the cobra loomed over them instead of making a run for it was pretty funny  especially because you could really tell that they were just screaming at an empty spot where the computer animators would later paint in the monster. I nearly fell out of my chair  though  when in a flashback scene they brought in either the cobra or the komodo - then normal size - in some indestructible solid steel container with some air holes drilled into it. Wouldn't a wire cage have sufficed? LOL! Guess they couldn't afford to rent a real komodo and cobra. I have to remember I rent Showtime for their series and not their movies.\n",

Walter Pidgeon is a truly unconvincing hero and even moreso when he tries to go undercover as a villain who  we're meant to believe  drinks too much and knocks his wife about a bit. Margaret Leighton  as the wife/undercover sergeant is a little more convincing but it's still difficult to believe that any hood worth their salt would not have seen through their charade in less than a minute. The plot  about a bullion heist  is silly  and the action drags rather than grips. David Tomlinson  who plays Algy in the same way that David Tomlinson seems to play all his roles  is the only glimmer of light in a wholly dull affair.\n",

      "This is about as stupid as it gets.  A classic case of two-dimensional characters who always act exactly contrary as to what a sane person would do in the same situation. It reminds me of a scene in Scary Movie where Carmen Electra flees from the killer. There are two signs  one marked to safety  the other one to sure death (I am reciting from memory).  And just like in Scary Movie  the characters always run into the direction marked Sure Death.   Why oh why did the girl start the fire in the teller booth AND HOLD THE DOOR SHUT ??? Did she prefer to die in the fire instead being killed by the guy? Why oh why  after cutting and overpowering the driver did they sit him in the seat and have him being watched by the wounded guy instead of plain shooting him or at the very least knocking him out? He was running over their friend and killing him a minute before  yet they have scruples ?? Why oh why a hundred things more ...   If this movie were a road  you could not drive a single yard because of the holes. Everything is so far-fetched  it's starting to physically hurt at times.  Add mercilessly overplaying actors and a small budget to that and here's what you get. Looking at the rating and the comments  I get the feeling those people have been watching an entirely different movie.  The one thing missing really  is the infamous red toolbox from While She was out - a movie that is about similar in unrealistic plot and stupid behavior of the characters.\n",

However  seeing it for a second time two things stand out: (1) very poor acting on the part of Michelle Johnson  and (2) very poor music throughout.  It's not that all the music was bad. Some of the Brazilian music was fine  but the theme song and others that clanged their way in were reminiscent of the worst of '80s pop music.  Johnson's voice seemed all wrong  possibly dubbed. This was distracting.  On the positive side: (1) The story's not bad  (2) it's interesting seeing such a young Demi Moore  (3) Valerie Harper never looked better  and (4) Johnson did look quite fetching in various stages of disattire.\n",

      "Solo is a poor film - that cannot be ignored. The acting for the most part is very wooden (the only exception is Adrien Brody's performance as Solo's creator Bill) and the story is slight enough that you would probably forget it WHILST you where watching the film. That said  such films are more about the action than the plot/acting and  as such  live or die by the action set pieces - that after all is the point of such films - to give 14 year-olds something to smile at whilst the adults watch films of actual substance. And even on this Solo fails to deliver - what little action there is is poorly done  dull and uninspired. After seeing the trailer for this on television I was hoping for something along the lines of Predator with a robot replacing the Predaot. Instead I got a fairly lifeless action film with a poorly constructed attempt at depth by taking on message that robots can feel too. Watch Terminator II or Predator instead.. both classics that this film desperately wants to be except it lacks the inspiration or  to be fair  the budget.\n",

If you like to watch movies that start out with a good guy trying to catch a bad guy  then reveal clues to the motives of each throughout the movie  skip it. At the end of the movie i still didn't know why Stargher killed the women the way he did. When you set up such a ritualistic serial killer it would be nice to know where the rituals originated from. In Dreams was a similar pretty movie with a serial killer which also wasn't the best  but at least the whys of how he killed the girls was explained. They also hinted at a dark background for Vaughn's character but didn't explain  didn't really say why Lopez's child psychologist was so much better suited for this task than the rest of the people they interviewed  didn't give much of an explanation for the little kid's problem  etc. If the rest of the story is compelling  I don't care about details like how Stargher afforded all the fancy electronic equipment and underground chambers or why the FBI wasn't checking to see if he owned any other property or had access to out of the way places while they were waiting to see if the whole entering the killer's mind thing would work  but I do like to have a sense of what motivates the serial killer in a serial killer movie when he kills in such a complex manner.\n",

It is a 75 minutes film that felt like 175 minutes and has about 20 minutes of modestly engaging material. It's not bad in any offensive way  it just repeats things that have been said many  many times over and more interestingly and provocatively. With only a couple of exceptions  the interviews drone on and on and on  making little emotional contact or context to the whole topic.

      "Seeing that this got a theatrical release nowhere around the globe  it only serves as a reminder of were the careers of those talent-free ladies Denise Richards and Milla Jovovich went. It also is a particular grating kind of movie  the kind that think they are smart  funny and original while being poor in every aspect. Full blame can go to Brian Burns  who wrote and directed this potboiler. His script takes a quite unoriginal situation and goes exactly nowhere with it. The situations develop completely without any inner logic  besides that of a desperate scriptwriter. Characters are thinner than cardboard cutouts  behave stupid and without any real motivation. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the inclusion of Mrs. Richards. We don't believe her relationship with David Krumholtz's character for one minute and the way she is brought back into play after the one-hour mark is particularly pitiful. Why would anyone fall for a egocentric  self-obsessed  arrogant b**ch like this in the first place  much less a second time? Especially after having supposedly found his..erm...true love? And if any of these things aren't enough to completely sink this movie  than the central couple is. The coupling of Krumholtz and Jovovich is only slightly more believable or developed than the Richards-one  but it is to no avail. There is no chemistry  no spark  nothing that we might loosely accept as a credible couple. Worse  these two central characters are particularly annoying and irritating  doing annoying and irritating things the viewer finally has no interest in  whatsoever.  Overall  a very poor showing. Even die-hard rom-com fans might want to pass on this one  as there are dozens of movie made with more skill or more charm.\n",

      "I watched 5% of this movie tonight and you may tell me that I need to see the whole movie to understand it  but frankly I don't think so.  What the hell is the story in this movie? I saw a lot of people running around in a factory  shooting at everything around them.  Where to start? Okay..  1) They were shooting around the place as if it was the Terminator or something they were trying to kill. The entire place is made of metal  but not a single bullet sparked on the metallic surfaces.  2) No ricochet. Metal vs metal is bound to cause ricochets  but apparently no one got hit by a stray bullet.  3) Magic bullets? In one scene a bad-guy is standing right in front of a good-guy when another good-guy pops out behind the bad-guy and pumps him full of metal. You see the bullets exit his chest as it explodes in a bloody mist  but the good-guy right in front of him doesn't get hurt at all! 4) After having just splattered a human being all over the wall  the two good-guys tell each other some jokes and they laugh and look like teenagers playing with soft-guns.  5) Sound? At one point the good-guys cut a wire and an alarm goes off (who the hell cuts a wire just to set off an alarm?). The lady screams out Alarm in sector blah blah and the bad-guy boss says Okay.. this.. is.. not.. a.. drill.. blah blah in a very  very amateur kinda way. Ooh  we're getting ambushed by terrorists  this isn't a drill  but I'm gonna sound like I don't give crap.  6) Focus!! First you see the bad-guys load up on weapons. For some reason the same guy gets the same Uzi twice. Deja vu or loop of scenes? You literally see every single bad-guy receive the same kind of weapon and they lock and load the same way. The weapons dealer pops in the clip and the bad-guy extra no. XX locks and loads. When they started opening fire you HAD to see the barrel flashes. Boooring!! 7) Actors or dummies? One of the presumed good-guys throw down a smoke grenade for some reason and of course the bad-guys are suddenly inside the smoke because they're smoke-blind or something so they don't see it coming. They cough and moan as if it was Anthrax in the grenade. Then a semi-boss bad-guy arrives and he doesn't even cough when he enters the smoke  he just pushes the other bad-guys away and they suddenly realize that the smoke isn't Anthrax anyway.  8) B flick? I think yeah! A guy sliding down a metal pipe wielding a Uzi in his right hand shooting away at someone in his eye height apparently. I'd like to see a guy fire a Uzi with one hand and I'd like to see him go get his hand afterwards. Extra bloody gore mess in a B flick kinda way. Small *pops* and a red hole with a torn shirt indicates that this guy is dead. Though the first bullet hit his heart the good-guy who is a super trained green berets still feel the urge to empty his clip into the dead guy.  9) One of these mentioned trained soldiers jump out from his hide with an empty clip! How stupid can you be!? Always check your clip before facing an unknown amount of enemies! 10) Boring scenes. Like the barrel flash scenes and the lock and load scenes  the movie is filled with time wasting scenes of people running around in an apparently empty building. Cut to the action if you're going for a B flick movie  please.  My two cents on this movie.\n",

      "Acolytes presents an interesting mix of original concepts in screaming teen cliché horror with a more thriller-like pacing. In some ways Acolytes is very successful  but in many other ways the film fails miserably.  Overall Acolytes avoided the typical archetypes of the naivety and innocence of youth of endless horror films in the like of Cabin Fever  Texas Chainsaw Massacre  and countless other films where unsuspecting and relatively naive and innocent teenagers  have sex  run around screaming and one-by-one are plucked off by some sort of monster. Instead this innocence is replaced with pride  retaliation  and arrogance. The characters had several opportunities to save themselves from immanent death and despair  but failed to do so due to their own personal demons. In the end you were left with the feeling that there were no (and perhaps are no) innocent victims.  As the name implies  the film also touches greatly on following a leader or authority. This was used in a direct sense of if the main character would become like the serial killer and was also used less directly throughout the film. Following a central figure is a reoccurring theme throughout the film.  Through all this  the film makers also incorporated a lot of cliché  which I suspect was intentional and gave the film a unique mixture of depth as well as shallowness which I found intriguing. This  perhaps inadvertently  plays well with the characters who are  at first appearance very shallow but as the story unfolds it becomes obvious that they are  at least the two main male characters  quite complex.  Technically the film has a lot of problems however. The cinematography  which is typically regarded highly  I find rather sophomoric and over-stylized  utilizing formulaic 2/3 approaches far too rigidly. Many transitions I felt were also over-stylized. The use of symbolism was not only vague  but also greatly over used.  The plot was poorly planned and relied exclusively on misinformation in order to achieve a rather hokey twist ending  which was poorly resolved and leaves viewers confused. Methods used to resolve the climax are cheap and ill-prepared  motivations are routinely unclear  and major plot points remain untied in the end.  Overall  the film's relative originality  themes and thesis are lost in a maze of poor technical execution  over-stylized imagery  unclear motives  obtuse and unnecessary symbolism and cheap twists maintained only by a lack of or entirely incorrect information.  If the film were better executed  it would have been excellent. However  Acolytes receives only two stars in my opinion.\n",

I've heard so much about the TV series from my friends and practically everyone in Turkey  I was expecting to see a breakthrough in Turkish cinema. What a disappointment.  Me and my husband (who is an admirer of any movie with a bit of Turkish landscape and Turkish dialogues in it) only watched it all the way through because we had paid $20 for the DVD. Well  that was a boring way of wasting it.  It was confusing  at times overacted  whereas other times underacted. The storyline was not only confusing  but adding a gay man walking with his dog on the beach and using some toilet humor in the script to make it 'Hollywood' didn't also work for me.  The American characters were almost too stereotypical that it was neither funny nor realistic and like another user mentioned  the Turkish customs and lifestyle was irrelevant.   The camera movements had no significance. Adding a few Dervishes (never seen in them in Kapadokya by the way) and broken plates -Greek style- only made the movie even more confusing.   I am ashamed of this movie and all the noise the press has made about it. There are surely worthy movies made by Turkish directors which deserve more attention and respect.  I give this movie 1 out of 10.\n",

She was cruel  selfish  loving  unpredictable  witty  caustic  confident  sarcastic  lethal  untamable  ambiguous all at once. The original Aeon had layers upon layers of depth. She almost never allowed her personal emotions to show through. The original plot was deliciously ambiguous and thought provoking. You could never tell what Aeon's motives were. Aeon was a militant anarchist whereas Trevor was a radical idealist  because of this they could never have any semblance of a stable relationship.  In the movie:  Aeon Flux works for the Monicans and her political motives and personal motives are very clear. She was pretty  loving  vulnerable  easily tamable  emotional and very predictable. The Aeon in the movie had one layer of depth at most. The plot was obvious and contrived. Everything is completely laid out for you from the beginning. There was virtually no conflict between Aeon and Trevor  at least in terms of personal philosophies. The only conflict between them was that they were on different sides.  The movie was a horrible disappointment to me. I felt betrayed. They took the idea of one of my favorite animated characters of all time  squeezed all the depth and personality out of her  and pumped her full of Hollywood clichés. The essence of the animated series was completely lost in this movie.   The only reason I'm not giving this movie a 1 is because the visuals were incredible.

I thought I was going to view a somewhat classic horror film with a creative end that writers like to invent....that usually make no sense when writing a horror film  but as a viewer  we try to rationalize and understand. This ending was not creative. It was sick and has all the earmarks of a snuff movie. I am shocked it was edited to this ending  and more shocked that it will be out for distribution by the end of June 2009. It should not be shown in a theater. It is harmful to innocent minds on many levels....watch the movie  the ending  and you will understand this statement. Plus  included in the plot is a sweet little girl not yet 9 her character says. She is not in the snuff ending  but she is an integral part of the movie. Why do directors feel they need to shock with a sick flick in order to get recognition? The director is in the wrong line of work if she thinks this is an art film.\n",

      "My brother was working at a movie theater when I saw this movie; I saw it for free and still walked out. I have seen a lot of movies in my time but this was the worst. When people ask me what the worst movie I have ever seen was I mention this movie in less than one second. This movie is bad because it goes from one lame plot set-up to the next  it encourages stereotypes about blacks that are sickening and the flow is awful. If you want to see how to make children cry and vomit at the same time then study this movie. Okay  this movie is not good bad but terrible bad. If you are like one of those people that watch horrible movies for fun  like me  you will not even be able to make it through this very short film. Please for the love of God destroy all copies of this movie.\n",

      "Recap: Since the warrior queen Gedren raised and slaughtered most of Sonja's family  she has trained in the art of sword fighting. Now  Gedren has taken a very powerful talisman  that threatens to destroy the world if not destroyed  killing Sonja's sister in the process. Now Sonja is out for revenge  and to save the world. Along the way  she meets the very Conan-like (but not Conan  no!) Kalidor  the child-prince Tarn and his bodyguard Falcon. At first Sonja declines all help  but is later forced to accept it  and together they go to save the world.  Comments: When you watch a movie like this  and you think that it is the story that the is the best element in this movie  the movie is in big trouble. Because 1) a movie like this should draw its strength upon good swordfights and effects  and 2) the story is really  really bad. It is simple  and uncomplicated and really offers nothing in way of character development or even suspense. It is predictable and boring  and the obvious couple  Sonja and Kalidor  has no chemistry at all. And the kid is just annoying. And most of the scenes is drawn out so long that they become boring. Though the movie is not very long  it has not material enough to fill its time. And so back to point 1). The fighting is slow  uneventful and really bad. It clearly shows most fighters clearly blocking the opponents strokes far ahead of the opponent has even begun to strike. In my honest opinion  I believe most kids  fighting with sticks  creates more exciting fights playing knights than this movie did. All in all  this is a really bad spin-off  that should be avoided by all who liked the Conan-movies.  2/10\n",

      "Guy Pearce looks like and acts like a Calvin Klein underwear model  or one of those bimbo guys who wear Levi's Jeans and stand in front of a herd of stampeding Buffalo because they realize that Buffalo like Levi's too. In every scene  Guy Pearce looks like he is saying  Look at me  I am so pretty! As a hero  his character is a total wimp. In every scene that calls for courage  Pearce gets the short end of the stick. SPOILERS: Yet  at the end of the movie  this wimpy book-worm character out-runs a pack of baboon-like Morlocks who can run and leap along the side of the walls (like Spiderman). Around the same time  the TIME MACHINE seems to cause a Nuclear Explosion of some kind that wipes out an entire valley. Strangely  even though Pearce and his gal-pal Mumba are about a foot away from the last Morlock that gets killed; seconds later Pearce  Mumba  and the tribe are watching the valley blow up from the safety of their mountain. Now THAT is FAST RUNNING!!! Jeremy Irons as the King of the Morlocks is great. He really makes the movie a lot better than it was. Mumba  the model-turned-actress is not very cute  and she does not do much acting in this movie. The scenes which take place in the 1900s lack any real atmosphere. Even though the period dress and vehicles are shown  the characters act like caricatures of how they imagine 1900s people would walk and talk. The original version of this movie was a lot better in this respect. The period characters were much more realistic  and they were much better actors. The original version of this movie made the PAST seem like the real base of the characters. This new version lacks substance and feeling. The scenes in which Pearce deals with the death of Emma and then fails to save her from her fate are very good. The issue of the Morlocks being cannibals is not very well explained  and it does not make sense that they have some large dark butcher shop filled with knives and cutlery  yet they are never seen using any weapons except for a blow-dart. Also silly is the giant pit full of water and bones. All through the underground  the Morlocks are all walking around chewing on meaty bones. So how can all those skeletons be in the pit? It seems like there are some Morlocks that Bar-B-Que their humans and eat them off the grill  and other Morlocks only like filleted flesh?? And where are the restrooms for all of these creatures? As I was watching the dozens of Morlocks who were gorging themselves on human flesh  it occurred to me that they must have a very advanced toilet & plumbing system  considering that they were tossing in lots of bones. All these issues were never addressed. At the end of the movie  Pearce is holding Mumba's hand  but you can see that he is eye-balling her friend  Mandingo. One other totally irritating thing about this movie is the non-stop LION KING music which is in the background. Once Pearce arrives in the future (802 710 a.d.); the LION KING music never stops  and every time the natives are around  there is that African Moaning Singer (Is it Peter Gabriel or Paul Simon?) that starts wailing and moaning over the LION KING jungle music. I watched the credits at the end of the movie  and the jungle music is not specifically identified  but I think that Elton John should probably look into this matter. Time Machine was a mediocre movie with some good FX. See it once  then forget it.\n",

      "If you're an average guy like me and enjoy good acting  good plot  good scripts  novel ideas  or being entertained  you might want to skip this one. I was honestly bored from the opening credits to the very end  but tried to give the film a chance  and watched it all the way through -- only to be disappointed at every turn.  The acting was unbelievably sub par  but I'm not sure if the actors themselves are to blame or if it was the ridiculously wooden and horrible dialog coupled with an even worse script. The plot is very vague and underdeveloped and I think the audience is supposed to derive some kind of deeper meaning from it  or be able to look past it in some way  but honestly to do so would be a waste of time.  The film has a kind of crude sexuality to it which doesn't serve any purpose other than to show off some tattoos and lingerie. No one seems to have any motivation except making money off of some kind of investment deal that is never really explained. The connections between the characters aren't terribly clear  and there is little to no character development.  This is either some kind of sub-culture film meant for a very specific audience to enjoy or absolute crap  but you can decide for yourselves.  I gave it a 2 because it is definitely one of the worst films I've ever seen  but probably not THE worst.\n",

The images were weirdly interesting but I was looking more for a biographical and/or critical accounting of Caravaggio's life and works  not an LSD type drug trip. The dialogue was very confusing and jumping back and forth in time via the use of trains  calculators  typewriters and cigarettes was extremely distracting. Had it been labelled an artsy film I wouldn't have purchased the DVD; now I have a DVD that I'll never watch again and who would buy it?

      "First  let me start off by saying this film SOUNDED very interesting: A serial killer copycatting the works of Edgar Allan Poe (who is one of my writers of all time). Sounds cool  right? Yeah  definitely not. Probably the worst film I've ever seen. Ever. And that's not an exaggeration. I've seen a lot of very  very bad movies. This one takes the cake. And I was even prepared for a bad movie before going into it.  Perhaps the writer should've studied some law enforcement procedure: If you have the name of the killer  his entire life's history  a criminal record  and HIS ADDRESS  where is the first place you should look? Hmm. . . possibly. . . his house? What?! NO! That's a preposterous idea  Anthony! How could you suggest something so obvious and level-headed rather than going to a bowling alley? *spoilers end* Honestly  sometimes I can forgive a movie if the writing is good but the acting is bad  or vice versa. . . but this just had everything wrong with it you could possibly find.  I think my biggest pet peeve was how the police/FBI acted.  For example: Black FBI Agent: Okay  endangered female  just sit here in this car in an empty parking lot while I go inside and look around the potential crime scene where a serial killer is supposed to be. Sound good to you? Moronic Female FBI Agent: Yeah  sounds a-okay to me. Go right ahead. I'll be sure to not focus on my surroundings or at least check the perimeter. Black FBI Agent: Excellent  that's what I would do! Honestly  if you want to be in law enforcement  rent this movie so you can learn how not to act. . . or if you're a human and want to learn the same.  0.5/10: A half-point just for getting a film produced and in stores.

It´s no doubt a cable-movie and not one for the theatre. Fortunately after 90 minutes the movie stops otherwise the audience should have taken an anti-virus against sleep. One thing came over: it was the nice country the film has been shot. You can really feel the American air but that´s all. I hope for Steven Seagal that he finally succeeds in a big hit.

A girl who likes him wants to help him but she is led to believe that his fears are caused by a mental illness...  Interesting plot  very good acting  but the result as a whole is poor in many ways. The story is too simplistic  or rather  presented in a simplistic way (even though there is a couple of interesting plot twists). For example  people say they love each other after only two meetings. I don't want to reveal anything else  but you 'll see what I mean if you watch the movie. Come on  it was the fifties!  you may think. Yet I 've seen quite a few films from that era and I know that some don't seem so dated nowadays.  Something that disturbed me was that some scenes were shot pitch dark  making it almost impossible to watch what was going on. Ok  it's a film-noir but this one is too noir at some points... :o)  Overall  the Second Woman is not a masterpiece of that era  but no trash either. Watch it if you have nothing else to do...\n",

      "It borrowed scenes from LOTR  Matrix  Star Wars  etc. The humor is so dry  contrived  and corny  that you can't help but laugh occasionally at its inanity and the fact that you are watching it. Exactly what you'd expect from an HK comedy. The average person would enter with an IQ of 100 and leave with less than 80. Stephen Chow is an obvious omission from this movie. The humor would have worked better with Stephen. The Mandarin version of this movie is not as good as the Cantonese original. The graphics are poor compared to its Hollywood counterparts. There is overdependence on low quality CG. My biggest complaint is its ending. The origin of the white horse is so clearly described in the Journey to the West (JW)  that this alternate explanation does not work well with story line. Despite its many flaws this movie has far more entertainment value than the other movie Nicholas Tse starred in--The Promise.\n",

I can't imagine five people as self-absorbed as they are would manage to remain friends with each other for ten years.

      "I logged on here right after watching this movie  feeling that it was so awful that at least its reviews might be entertaining. But all you miscreants appear to kind of like it. And so  since I want the job done right...  From the opening shot  the movie establishes its contempt for the audience's attention span by showing an entirely unremarkable picture of an irrelevant bridge for a long  long time. Then it goes to some slow-motion skateboarding  which is at least a little bit cool  but then offsets that glimmer of excitement by overlaying the most repellent soundtrack song I've ever heard. Some girl screeching in whispery French over what sounds like sheets of plywood banging together. Whoever decided that needed to be there has never ridden a skateboard  I guarantee it. It seemed to be there to test the limits of the audience's patience.  From there  the movie is about 50 per cent slow motion. You know what's worse than a gratuitous slow-motion shot? A gratuitous slow motion shot of *nothing happening.* Here's a guy walking along a path. Here's a guy sitting. Here's a guy looking around. Here's a guy looking at another guy. After a while I started watching the movie at double speed  bringing it back down whenever people appeared on screen engaging in actual dialog  which was rare. Once  astonishingly  I slowed the movie to find out what a girl was saying  only to find that the camera was showing her talking  but the sound was another horrible  horrible song and her actual voice was not audible.  This reminds me of some great advice I heard once about writing -- if you don't have anything to say  don't use fancy tricks to pretend as though you do. Get back to work and think of something to say. All these camera tricks  like the slow motion and weird lighting and lenses and freaky music  is what the absence of content looks and sounds like. A lot of people have apparently bought it  and perceive emotional gravity and deep meaning  but I think they are projecting this onto a movie that did not do any of the work involved in creating it.\n",

      "Being a huge horror movie fan  one of the most difficult things to be considering the lack of abundance of good movies in the genre  and having seen hundreds of them in my lifetime  I have to say that Dracula 3000 is by far the most uninspired  lame and poorly done piece of trash I have had the misfortune to see. STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE! It's so bad it's not even laughable. The special effects (did I say special?) were probably achieved spending a couple of grand  the acting is terrible and the script should have ended up in the trash bin after the first read by the studio that decided to take on this miserable project. The whole movie was literally filmed in a warehouse. Also  for you guys out there who like nudity in your movies  don't be fooled by the R rating. If you're thinking you get a chance to see Erika Eleniak even half-naked  you're wrong. She is fully clothed throughout the entire movie. And the cover art is completely misleading! There is no scene in any part of the movie that even marginally resembles the awesome cover art they put on the box to draw unsuspecting horror fans.  Too bad the rating is only 1 to 10.

On the present days  Karen Tunny (Lori Heuring) has just lost her husband after a long period of terminal disease when the family savings have been spent in the treatment. Without any money  she moves with her daughters Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and Emma (Chloe Moretz) to an old house in the mountains that belonged to her husband. Karen is advised by her neighbors to stay at home in the night  and Sarah hears that there are zombies in the area. When Emma becomes friend of Mary  he mother believes she is an imaginary friend. However  when Sarah's friends are attacked and eaten alive by zombie children and Emma vanishes  Karen and Sarah chase her nearby the mine.  Wicked Little Things is not a totally bad movie: the acting is good; the make-up is creepy; and the cinematography and the music score are excellent. However  the story  and consequently the screenplay  are very weak  indeed a bad collection of clichés. The beginning is reasonable  with a widow moving to a house in a remote location because the family spent all their resources with the illness of the patriarch. But when she arrives  coincidently the little zombies attack people without any consequences  for example  families do not search the missing persons. Then the wicked Mr. Carlton comes to the place with the most disgusting attitudes  a typical clichés that he will die in the end. There is no explanation why the children attacked innocent people and why they should stop after killing Mr. Carlton. When Sarah is running away with her mother and says that she is tired and cannot run anymore  it is one the most stupid lines that I have ever seen in a horror movie. My vote is four.

      "This movie obviously had good intentions. At the end there is a dedication to someone named Kellie who  as a viewer  I can only assume found herself in a situation similar to the one the movie depicts. Perhaps she made the wrong choice. That dedication is the ONLY redeeming quality of Love & Suicide.  The movie becomes unbearable from the opening sequence. Once the viewer is already that irritated only about five minutes into the film  it's pretty much going to be downhill after that...which it was. I know the film was low budget and the camera shots were actually pretty good...unfortunately  everything else was horrid. The acting  the plot  the sound quality  the picture quality...the acting. I'm sorry but the acting is horrible. Beyond horrible. It's as if the actors are trying to act like people acting. That's the only way I can think to describe it. As I watched  I actually pictured the script with the stage direction in my mind. None of the movements were natural and none of the characters' reactions to one another fit. In short: the timing is WAY off. The timing of the entire film is way off. I'm no director so I know the limits of my knowledge but I really feel there had to be SOME way to convey the passing of time...until they explained about graduation not being too far away I was under the impression that the first portion of the movie had taken place over the span of a week...a month at most.  All that being said  it's really a shame. This movie truly could have been powerful with a little tweaking. All the moments in the film in which we are supposed to feel something are obvious but only because the set-up is obvious (which is a bad thing). The moving scenes totally fell flat. For instance  when Kaye's brother takes his hat of his head and puts it on hers  we should feel the understanding he has for her  the innocence and protectiveness of the love of her brother...somehow it just doesn't come off that way. There are so many more scenes like this (for example: ALL of the fight scenes) and all they do is take away from the movie. All these things put together  Love & Suicide comes off as one long  cheesy  low-budget commercial.\n",

      "Hellboy revolves around classic comic book/action/superhero genre story lines. Essentially Hellboy is a kind of demon who has found his way on earth. He is brought up from a child by a priest and within a government society and has chosen to protect the people of earth from the supernatural  rather then be a menace (the normal career route for a demon).  The set up of the story involves creative uses of history  combining Nazi experiments with the occult. It's preposterous  but so is the whole idea of a demon roaming the streets. I find the explanations of the characters  who they are and how they came to be very well handled. The sequences are to the point and very entertaining. In fact the opening is the best part of the film  therein lays the problem",
      ".  Essentially Del Toro who both writes and directs this piece bottles it. The film is absent of all tension or any major conflict. Hellboy is essentially established as invincible within the first act and so the rest of the film comprises of scenes in which any conflict is automatically rather crass because we know inevitably Hellboy will be OK and the bad guy will die. I hear you cry that this is the case for any action/hero film. Well yes it is  but once we are drawn into a well made action film we can't help but feel the hero may die. Die Hard works because John Mclane looks likely to die at all parts. He escapes death by the slimmest of margins. The stakes are raised as his wife is also in danger etc etc",
      " Terminator and Terminator two work because in both cases the villain is far superior than the hero. The threat and tension is constant.  Some of the other major weaknesses are: Del Toro is also guilty of employing deus ex machina. Characters generally disappear and reappear as their skills are needed within the story. The villain is featured in maybe three scenes. He has no motives. Turns up unexpectedly and inexplicably. In the one scene Hellboy looks to be up against a real threat (groups of monsters) a character unleashes her abilities - the screen fades to white and inexplicably the monsters are dead but everybody else lives. A minor character established in an irritating and undeveloped love story becomes the key to the conclusion of the film. Her character is so thin  the relationship so undeveloped. It is clear she is nothing more than a prop of sorts to push the plot along and to make it all make sense. I don't want to ruin the ending of the film but essentially a character that is dead is miraculously and unbelievably brought back to life",
      ".  The film suffers from poor dialogue and one liners that just aren't smart or funny. After a while it all starts to grate.  What's more Del Toro blows the action scenes with some uninspired visuals. And whoever made the creative decision to make hellboy's primary weapon a gun instead of his clunking arm should be fired. Essentially the use of the gun weakens the concept of the film  degrading the fights to nothing more than a one sided shoot out   The few positives include: The cinematography is very good. At all times a sense of mood is established by the dark lighting and the darker colour palette. As well as the use of interesting locations. Yet perhaps it is all a bit samey as well.  The use of cgi and Fx is well done. Never do we get an over load. When effects are used they are used well and the sense of realism is kept. Rather similar to how Nolan used FX in batman. I much prefer this method to the overtop effects we often see.  All in all this is a pretty poor film. The real shame is that (despite not reading the comics) I found the film wasted a lot of potential. Hellboy as a character has a lot of instantly apparent fascinating dimensions which are completely unexplored. The film has watch-ability  in the sense that if it comes on TV and nothing else is on it might be worth a viewing. But in any other situation I wouldn't bother with it.\n",

      "At the beginning of the movie  Ramgopal Verma says that Sarkar is his tribute to The Godfather. This one feels more like an insult. It pales terribly in comparison to the Coppola classic. Although no one was expecting Ramgopal Verma to fill Coppola's shoes  the movie did create a lot of expectation and buzz.   Amitabh Bachchan plays Sarkar  a character automatically drawing instant comparisons to Indian political party Shiv Sena's Supremo Bal Thackeray. Abhishek Bachchan plays his son Shankar who returns from abroad and gets caught up in Sarkar's politics at home. Just like Al Pacino in the original Godfather.   As most Bollywood fare  incidents and characters are overtly simplistic and devoid of any kind of solid foundation. Quick phone calls and sudden announcements turn the film from one direction to another. Abishek takes to Mumbai's murky underworld politics-crime nexus like a duck takes to water. Amithab Bachchan as Sarkar is supposed to look magnificent and powerful  he just ends up looking old and clueless. Most of his acting is centered around constantly staring at different things around the movie set - the actor in front of him  the floor or in some other random direction.   However  Kay Kay performs exceedingly well as the wronged elder son Vishnu. So does Zakir Hussain as Rashid  the Dubai based dope smuggler who wants to gets his footing in Mumbai. This actor has awesome screen presence and can send chills down your spine with just the way he looks. The moment he enters the screen  you want to run and hide under the bed.   All its obvious flaws not withstanding  the film did well at the box office. The buzz and the big star cast obviously helping. Also Verma manages to hold your interest albeit mildly towards the later half of the film. He is actually making a sequel to this one which I am sure will be more of the same fare.\n",

      "I finally rented this video after searching for it for many months. Initially I only wanted to see it because I'm an out and out Neil Pearson fan (Patrick  boyfriend of Isobel  the lead). However  the movie stands up very well without Neil (although he handles himself very well in this movie  he is overshadowed by the three main female characters). It's an eerie  intense movie  the sort the Brits do so well - definitely a chick flick the house and it's isolated setting giving the movie an almost Wuthering Heights aura. The movie is full of tension and the ending  shocking  yet somehow inevitable. I'm glad I watched it  it was worth the wait\n",

      "This is a poor caricature of Lonesome Dove - and Larry McMurtry.  I love your books  with Lonesome Dove among the top three. I have admired the way you view yourself  through your characters  with such unflinching honesty  balanced by never taking it all too seriously. I am  therefore  spoiled.  Why have you come to this?  Comanche Moon is not up to your standards. I see that you are credited with the screen-writing  but this is so unlike you  I prefer to think it is written by someone else.  The dialogue makes me claustrophobic  wishing someone would break out with a naturally stated sentence. The part about 'genius' was agonizing. McCrae was unrecognizable - chiefly because of the inane words coming out of his mouth.  Well  I miss Call  too.  The most important missing factors are Gus and Call and the men they are: their matter-of-fact courage; the underlying vein comprised of ethics and honesty; their lack of self delusion. Hard men leading hard lives with a certain undeniable grace.  Some blame has to attach to the labored direction here and throughout. All of the cast needed dialect AND dialogue coaching.  While I try to imagine Robert Duvall as McCrae  speaking this same dialogue  it comes off better - but not much. It tries to sound cowboy-of-few-words shy  sly-grin witty  but doesn't half succeed...  How can it be so different from Lonesome Dove? Can the writer have forgotten his characters? You have fooled some of the people  Mr. McMurtry - but not this one.\n",

A bunch of women are kept in a prison and tortured as they try to escape.  This is really terrible. Even as exploitation films go.

      "When i went to the video rental shop to get a movie i saw this one and i immediately thought it would be funny. The picture made it seem like a classic comedy type involving teenagers (such as road trip)which i thought would be worth watching. When i turned the move on i was disappointed as the jokes were awful and cheesy. The only bit which the director may have thought would be funny was somebody slipping over on a wet floor. This is not a joke and would not make people laugh. I actually considered turning this movie off coming to half way through. I was annoyed with this movie as it was just a waste of time and money renting it out. Not enough care was taken making this film and not enough time and work put into it. I found the acting to be quite bad as well. The only time i laughed was at the extremely bad 'jokes'or actions done which were really not funny!!!. I rate this film a 1/10.

I mean  this kind of show would certainly be alright if everyone knew that homeschoolers weren't really like this  and the whole story was just for the show  but unfortunately not everyone is aware of this. If anyone out there that watched this actually believed this is what goes on in the life of a homeschooler  then I honestly feel sorry for them.

I was really expecting a Bonnie And Clyde movie and I got Dick Clark playing a shy nerdy guy while Robert Walker and Diane Varsi played an poor attempt of reinacting Bonnie and Clyde. Needless to say it never went over well. Maybe this is why it never made it to video. Even as a kid I was left some what ripped off as I left the theater. After all the best parts where in the trailer of the movie. The movie was dull and pretty much pointless. By the way  Dick Clark gets killed so it wasn't a total let down.\n",

      "Staten Island filmmaker Andy Milligan is well known in the horror community for being an even worse director than Ed Wood. And with this as a dim example of his output I'm apt to agree with them. In The Ghastly Ones we basically have three bickering couples traveling to their childhood home (located on a conveniently secluded island) to collect an inheritance. There they are killed off one by one and the events unfold in murder/mystery fashion with a scarred retard hunchback butler added to throw you for a loop. The film is in such bad shape that it looks like someone just ran it through a dishwasher  the sound is terrible  the dialog is otherworldly bad  there's some primitive mannequin gore (plus some dismemberments and guts) and it's technically inept in every possible way it can be inept. But is it enjoyable in a bad movie kind of way? Sort of. It's excruciating to watch but oddly entertaining in a train wreck fashion. Approach with caution. If you're not a fan of horrible movies better deep six this one.\n",

I wanted something that was mindless and that I could just sit back and say  what the hell were they thinking? I was not disappointed in this undertaking  but had I been watching this one in a serious mood  I would have been irate. The company that made this thing just spliced CGI footage from the first Octopus and added a little footage with a fake octopus that makes the one used in Bride of the Monster look like a masterpiece of special effect footage. Since when does an octopus have fangs? The plot is that an NYPD diver is investigating some murders/disappearances on the Hudson River shortly before the Fourth of July. He and his partner (who is soon to be transferred  or soon to be munched on by a fig bucking octopus) investigate in a rather inept manner (all the while believing that a huge octopus will kill people) and are occasionally accompanied by a female lackey from the Mayor's office. Of course on one believes that an octopus can get that big until the thing attacks the cop and the girl from the mayor's office. Surprisingly  all hell doesn't break loose and only a few cops and a few more civilians are killed.  Really lame. Don't bother with it.\n",

      "I rated this one better than awful because I liked seeing Jonathon from Buffy in something again -- even if it was the same role.  First  the concept is kind of cute for a short  but not an entire movie. The writing was forced and contrived. I have the feeling that the movie suffered the most during editing.  Second  Amanda Bynes always looks like her eyes are crossed -- even when she's not trying to do it. She's just not funny. She always plays some sort of misfit girl who triumphs by being herself -- ironic  considering Amanda seems to always be a caricature. I would actually like to see her in something serious. I really want to give her a chance  but she is always cast in these trite roles where she wiggles and makes faces and somehow that's a good thing?  Finally  the whole I'm a Dork segment was ripped off from Revenge of the Nerds. There was nothing in this movie that was unpredictable.  Shame  shame  shame.\n",

      "The other day I showed my boyfriend a great movie  Stand By Me  a movie I have shown to many people and they absolutely adored it  but for some odd reason he didn't like it. He lends me a movie called Backdraft and he tells me that he's shown it to many people and they loved it  instead I hated this movie. I don't think I've hated a movie so much in a while  how this movie has even a 6.6 rating is beyond me. I couldn't keep up with the five million stories here: Billy Baldwin becoming a fire man  the random sibling rivalry  the random love story(s)  the who's being an arson story  the investigator  the fire who has a personality of it's own. I just have a problem that this movie can't keep up with all these stories  they didn't balance out well enough make the film interesting. I would have just preferred if this movie was about being a firefighter or the investigator and how he came to be one or what it is exactly he does and why.  The movie tells the story of a group of Chicago firefighters  two brothers. Stephen Bull McCaffrey  the elder brother  is obsessed with the beating of the fires that he fights. Brian  the younger brother quit the fire fighting academy school several years before  then embarking on a number of other unsuccessful careers before returning to become a firefighter. He is looked down on by his elder brother who expects him to fail in his newly chosen career as a fire fighter. Donald Shadow Rimgale is an arson investigator who is dedicated to his profession. He is called in because a number of fires that have occurred have somewhat similar connections. .Martin Swayzak is an alderman on the City Council. He has obvious hopes of being elected to mayor  but has had to make a number of budget cuts to the fire department. Many of the rank and file firemen believe that the cuts that he has made are endangering the lives of the firefighters. However  Swayzak is initially successful in portraying the fire department as bloated and ineffectual after firemen are repeatedly being killed in blazes.  I just couldn't get into this movie  I don't know how anyone else could  it was incredibly unrealistic and portrayed firefighters all wrong. I loved how they had every action cliché in the book to match this action flick. I just felt also like there was great talent wasted on such mediocre roles  Donald Sutherland  great actor  but such a strange role that could have been taken by a lesser known man who had the upcoming talent at the time. I know Ron was going for great quality  but I think him casting such huge actors in small roles was a mistake for this film. I even had to joke my way through while watching this movie commenting how the doctor in the background was probably Kevin Spacey. The fire was so unrealistic and the movie was just so out there  I didn't enjoy it and honestly wouldn't recommend it to people  I'll stick to the recommendations in my relationship from this point on.  2/10\n",

      "L'Humanité is a murder mystery. These movies tend to be popular   and the 6.9 rating it currently has suggests that it has been  too.  Unfortunately  this movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  A few non-spoilers  for instance  include a 5-minute scene  wherein the main character eats an apple. And another 3 minutes  where he breathes.  In case you were wondering  this is not  in fact  art. Neither is it a  commentary on humanity  which from the title it seems it is trying  to be. It is  in fact  boring. There are numerous attempts in this  movie to say something about humanity. One might think to  onesself  How would I comment on humanity? And the most  obvious and boring answers will of course be sex  love  and death.  Not that these options are uninteresting when done well - just that  they are the canonical options. For sex  this movie does its best to  make it unattractive and disgusting. In your first five minutes -  hence this is not a spoiler - you will see the bloodied vagina of a  murdered 11-year-old girl; it's a murder mystery  remember? Later  on  a few people throw themselves at each other and have what  the director would like us to believe is raw sex  but in reality it's  contrived and overly symbolic - but worse yet  uninterestingly so.  I enjoy being disturbed by movies. This movie showed me why:  Disturbing movies usually show something inside of someone   their humanity  which they did not know existed and are a bit  scared of. L'Humanité tried to do just this and failed  and I walked  out of the theatre not disturbed  but disgusted  thinking that I had  wasted my time in the theater  despite having seen the movie for  free.\n",

      "  Summary: Not worth the film  As an avid Gone With the Wind fan  I was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters. Luckily  the film on its own was a wonderful piece. When the book Scarlett came out  I read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together. While the book lacks any true quality  it remains a good story  and  as long as I was able to separate it from the original  was and still is enjoyable. However  I consider the six hours I spent watching the Scarlett miniseries to be some of the worst-spent hours of my life. Discrediting any of the original character traits so well-formed in Margaret Mitchell's book  this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape  mistrust  murder  and misformed relationships that even the book Scarlett stayed away from. The casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well-formed in both the original novel and film  and even carried through in the second book  and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character. In the novel  Scarlett O'Hara Butler follows her estranged husband Rhett Butler to Charleston under the guise of visiting extended family. After coming to an arrangement with Rhett  she agrees to leave  and proceeds to reconnect with her O'Hara relatives in Savannah. Eventually  she accompanies her cousin Colum  a passionate leader of the Fenian Brotherhood  to Ireland  to further explore her family's roots that go deep  and is eventually named The O'Hara  the head of the family. While her duties as The O'Hara keep her engaged in her town of Ballyhara  Scarlett ventures out into the world of the English landowners  and instantly becomes a sought-after guest at many of their parties. She  having been scorned by Rhett time and time again  eventually agrees to marry Luke  the earl of Fenton  until Rhett comes along in a clichéd night-on-white-horse - type of a rescue. The Scarlett miniseries fails even to do this justice. Raped by her fiancé and scorned by her family  the series shows Scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed.  I heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision.  \n",

But unfortunately Brass pictures are feature films with the pretense of wanting to entertain viewers for over two hours! In this they fail miserably  their undeniable  but rather soft and flabby than steamy  erotic qualities non withstanding.  Senso '45 is a remake of a film by Luchino Visconti with the same title and Alida Valli and Farley Granger in the lead. The original tells a story of senseless love and lust in and around Venice during the Italian wars of independence. Brass moved the action from the 19th into the 20th century  1945 to be exact  so there are Mussolini murals  men in black shirts  German uniforms or the tattered garb of the partisans. But it is just window dressing  the historic context is completely negligible.  Anna Galiena plays the attractive aristocratic woman who falls for the amoral SS guy who always puts on too much lipstick. She is an attractive  versatile  well trained Italian actress and clearly above the material. Her wide range of facial expressions (signalling boredom  loathing  delight  fear  hate ... and ecstasy) are the best reason to watch this picture and worth two stars.

I'd definitely not recommend teenagers to watch this movie. What really makes me feel dejected is how could such an impressive banner like Yash Chopra Films ever succumb to such an awful production? They have perhaps forgotten to keep in view that there is a larger audience than adult audience too  which when exposed to these sort of gross movies may wreck their growing mind set and succumb to things devoid of sense and recognition.  On the whole  films must not only be entertaining  but also must comprise of some sense as well. Certainly  this film is an immense disappointment to Yash Chopra fans  especially me myself. I am really disappointed over the plot  acting and everything else. Why can't people put in some substance that can be cherished after confronted with in the films  at least for once throughout the film? The point is clear.

      "Cobb. It sucked. I learned nothing about the man I had not heard before. The performances were over the top. A scene where Cobb and Al are driving down a snowy road in search of women in Reno has to be one of the worst conceived scenes in recent memory. It's just plain STUPID and unentertaining. The flashback sequences were terrible. And they used the same sequences OVER AND OVER AND OVER again. If I saw the same shot of Cobb fighting with someone at a base one more time  I would have become physically ill. By watching this 'movie'  we get to learn NOTHING of what it was like in Cobb's era. We learn nothing about his relationship with his players  nothing about his days as a manager  nothing about his relationship with his family members  other than that `they don't like him'. I thought when I sat down to view this film I would learn SOMETHING about the era of baseball in which Cobb played. Instead  all I got to see was a retread of how Cobb hated everything and everyone  and how they hated him. Boy  what a great movie (sarcasm intended). Cobb is portrayed as a constant liar in the film  so which one of his stories is supposed to be accurate? Who knows? Who cares? No one will after viewing this piece of crap. If you decide to rent this film  make sure the fast forward button on your VCR is working  as you will be tempted to use it repeatedly. Hopefully someday someone will make a GOOD film about Ty Cobb.

I remember when I first saw Buscemi's full length directorial debut  Trees Lounge. I enjoyed the movie  although it wasn't as good as it could have been. It was -almost- there. It -almost- scratched that itch  the itch of wanting to see small movies about small people in small bars that are in small towns. It was close enough to where I would say that it was a very good movie - one that with a few tweaks could have been great. But that's OK. I like the movie and I've watched it more than once.  But this review is not about Trees Lounge. It's about Lonesome Jim. When I saw the description of the movie and then I saw who's movie it was  I was excited at the prospect of finally seeing the movie that I knew that Trees Lounge could have been. But what I actually experienced was not unlike that of leaving one of those smalltown bars with a belly full of cheap whiskey and an armful of cheap floozy  heading back to your apartment with a mushy brain full of exciting prospects that inevitably disintegrate into the reality of alcohol-induced impotence and headspinning regurgitation.  In other words  this movie left me flat and unrequited and sorry that I wasted the time and the money that it took me to get to that state - the film equivalent of waking up next to that cheap floozy the next morning  or if you happen to be the floozy  waking up next to that stinking and farting and unshaven imbecile. The film had all of the substance of a stale white bread sandwich (with store brand white bread  no less) and the emotion of a cadaver. I am not sure what the point of this film was  and since it was supposed to have some sort of a point and was not an exercise in abstract surrealism that can get by without one then this lack of a point is a sin of omission. Sorta like those new cars that don't come with ashtrays anymore although there are millions of people who smoke and buy new cars (I'm not one of them  but hey  I can sympathize). Overall it was a boring film about boring people doing boring things and had none of the grit and believability that can carry and save such a film. I mean  Trees Lounge was about boring people doing boring things  but it was interesting.   I blame a lot of this on Affleck. Why do people keep casting these Affleck turds? They suck the life out of anything that they are connected with. One Affleck was in one decent film (and wasn't even the reason why the film was decent) and all of the sudden every butthole named Affleck is stinking up as many films as they possibly can. And Liv Tyler is no better. Being the daughter of a rock star does not necessarily make an actress. She is as lifeless as Affleck. These people simply do not rise from the flat page of the script. People pay to see films and they deserve to see actors and actresses with a bit of charisma - these two duds together don't have the spark of the old guy who hands out shopping carts at Wal Mart. I always thought that Steve Buscemi was the type of guy who would rise above this type of pablum  but oh Steve you let us down. This film makes me want to stuff you into another wood chipper.\n",

      "This movie was playing on Lifetime Movie Network last month and I decided to check it out. I watched for the first 20 minutes and then shut it off b/c I am sorry but plot holes that are integral to a movie's plot make the movie nothing but garbage.  The movie is about a woman who accidentally runs a child on a bicycle off the road  leaves to get help  returns only to find out that it's being called a hit and run and there's a hunt for the 'monster' that hurt (in the end killed) her.  This is a movie about a female in an affluent neighborhood who has 2 small grade school children and who is an active  sociable woman and yet in order for this movie to work  it needs to be believable that she does not own a CELL PHONE. Sorry  but that's complete BS especially when everyone else seems to have one - they used theirs to call 911 when they found the girl lying on the side of the road - when our lead female left the scene of the crime to go phone 911 at some payphone. When the lead female comes back  the ambulance is already at the girl's side and there is chatter about how horrible the person is who hit and left her.  Just DUMB. Sorry but I am not willing buy that this woman doesn't own a cell phone which is needed for the movie to work. Please don't insult my intelligence movie  thanks. Maybe if this took place in 1970 or 1960  I'd buy it but it's clearly a present day (1999 at the time) movie. ..but wait  if she had a cell phone  there would be no movie. Pfft.  The woman clearly knows about technology since she had computers in her house  ones the kids played games on so all the movie had to do was make her cell phone dead in the car  making her resort to another way to call the cops.. leaving out a cell phone altogether just created a ridiculous plot.\n",

      "Whilst this is most definitely a well crafted piece of film-making  it's thoroughly without any entertainment value whatsoever.  If you're depressed already  this film will send you over the edge.  If you're feeling somewhat depressed  this film will be just one more thing in your life to feel bitter about. You'll feel that it's just your luck to have chosen to watch a movie that turns out to be a complete waste of time.  Otherwise you might be able to make it through this film unscathed (I didn't  BTW)  safe in the knowledge that your life is so much better than Jim's. Then again you might consider that you have been fooling yourself  and that are in fact in a much worse situation than you'd previously realized. You might feel a bit annoyed at Jim for bringing this to your attention. You may want to slap him around a bit with a wet fish.   The sad truth is  much as I wanted to like this movie... I hated it. It took rather a long miserable road down the path of oblivion and then suddenly  for no reason whatsoever  looked back at itself and then stopped.  Jim does not have an epiphany  at least not one that is conveyed on screen. Jim has a miserable life and a miserable set of options. He discovers nothing that one can relate to and fails to make any significant progress on his journey of self-discovery.   Of course no-one alive could write a happy ending to this movie. As others have said it's no Hollywood tale  it's gritty and it's real. It's well made. Life is quite a struggle at times. If anyone were to know the answer  they do well to shout it from the rooftops.  Still  I feel cheated because this movie pretends to have something to say. You feel that it's going to say something  that if you just suffer through a little more of it  it'll have something to say. It'll make you stop and think.   It doesn't.  Again  I do submit that this is a well crafted film. And therefore may be of value to a film student with a penchant for e.g. lighting techniques of the use of colour palettes.   For the rest of us  it's utterly miss-able.\n",

Perhaps as a young starlet  Ball could have pulled off a role like this  where her inherent beauty and youth could have carried her through...but this seemed a desperate attempt from an aged star to show that she was still viable in the field. The reason there are sooo many more supporters of Russell's version (aside from the fact that you cant improve upon the original) is that Russell had presence  she absorbs every scene  whereas Lucille Ball might as well be a pattern on the wallpaper in Mame for all the attention she commands in the role.\n",

      "The filmmaker stayed true to the most accurate account of the story published in 1894 which includes an 1846 manuscript by Richard Williams Bell (son of John and Lucy Bell and younger brother of Betsy Bell) titled Our Family Trouble. To knowledge this is the only eyewitness account ever penned. The filmmaker should be credited for accuracy but there is little to say about the production and acting quality. The acting was theatrical and the sound and picture quality was extremely poor. It appears that the filmmaker simply shot scenes of the reported events that took place without incorporating or weaving them into a flowing plot or story line.

      "First off  Mexican Werewolf in Texas' title is misleading as many others have pointed out. It is actually about El Chupacabra  which is a similar creature to a werewolf  but by no means the same.  The production and editing just plain suck. When it was over  I probably wouldn't be able to give a very accurate description of what exactly the Chupacabra looked like  for whenever it was in a scene(despite one or two exceptions) the camera turned all shaky and you could only see the monster's face clearly. The special effects were laughably bad  but that has to be expected from a low budget horror movie.  Along with the terrible production comes the bad actors. Now a couple give fairly plausible performances(Erika Fay and Martine Hughes)  but then there were the bad actors(everybody else)  who seemed to have no emotions whatsoever when people died. Then there's the absolutely terrible actor(Sara Erikson)  who gives one of the 2 worst performances I've ever seen in a movie. I mean my god  she was indescribably bad.  The plot was very simple. Basically  a Chupacabra is in a small Texan town killing off local residents and a group of teens look to stop it. However  even with the plot being this simple  a few plot holes managed to leak through.  Anyways  horrible movie. However  if you are looking for a movie to make fun of and laugh at with your friends one night  this would be a pretty good one. My friends and I had a good time watching this. Probably the 2nd worst movie I've ever seen  1/10. Awful.\n",

      "...I normally hate puns  but this seems the only appropriate summary for Barnyard. I suspect I am not the first. And I'm sure many  MANY comments focus on the idiocy of bulls with udders. It certainly bothered me right off the bat. But there's much more wrong with this movie than a fundamental lack of knowledge about how mammals work.  Personally  if I was a parent  I would be irritated by the violent turn it takes near the end in the showdown with the coyotes. (Although for me  it at least injected a little action.) And from a conventional screen writing point of view  you might expect the coyotes to play a greater role in the conflict(Gee- you have a widow cow...maybe her husband was killed by coyotes? Nope...there's a much dumber explanation.) And what kind of a farm is this? Otis vows to protect all the animals from harm  but there certainly seems to be no threat from humans. They make reference to the farmer being vegan  but what is he raising pigs for? In all children's animal stories- Babe  Charlotte's Web  you name it...the reality of farm life is at least touched on. Perhaps our friendly farmer is running some sort of rescue shelter (there is some reference to this  but it's never explained.) But all the farmer gets in return is abuse from a horse in a scene that is supposed to be funny  but left me seriously wondering if he was going to wind up buried in a shallow grave behind the barn. And what the heck is the deal with Wild Mike? It was like the Gimp scene in Pulp Fiction without the ball-gag.  Add in some truly awful attempts at emotional scenes  a nearly complete lack of laughs  and THOSE UDDERS  and you've got the worst kids movie I've seen in ages. I generally only post to IMDb to highlight a film that's not so well known- not to slam the current #2 box-office hit. But this movie ANGERED me. It was taking up space in my local theater  space that could have been used to show something worthwhile. There's been plenty of good family entertainment this summer- in fact there were at least 2 more kids films playing at the same multiplex. But I'm not allowed to see something like Little Miss Sunshine so Viacom can cheat families out of an extra $30. At least I had a free pass.  I know that as a 35 year old with no children  this film was not designed for me. But there's just no excuse for such a lazy  dreadful children's film as Barnyard in the age of Pixar. I was bored by the Ice Age films  but they certainly didn't anger me like Barnyard. Shark Tale was a weak attempt at street hipness  but it had quite a few laughs. For that matter  you could turn on Nickelodeon at any time of the day  and see something more entertaining and intelligent- which is why they should be ashamed for putting their name on this garbage.  I'm giving it a 2 out of 10  only because Pip The Mouse was sporadically amusing  and Maria Bamford had a few amusing lines as the farmers wife. Well  not THE farmer's wife. Some other farmer. They didn't really explain who she was. They didn't explain a lot of things. Especially not why Sam Elliot- the ultimate man's man- had an udder jiggling around down there. Creepy.\n",

      "My wife spotted this film on the aisle at a local video store. From the cover it looked like a science-fiction film  but upon turning it over my wife saw Rebecca St. James was in the film  realized it was a Christian movie  and suggested we watch it. We are conservative evangelicals but we also know that Christian films have a poor reputation in the mainstream. Nevertheless  we decided to give it a screening.  To be fair  there were a few things I liked about the film. The musical score - much of which was orchestrated - was quite good. The cinematography was also pretty good considering it was a lower-budget movie.  Unfortunately  any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script. The film begins with an interesting premise - UFO abductions - but by midway through the feature the storyline veers wildly into an evangelistic crusade spearheaded by the movie's two main characters... which then veers wildly into a treatise on the Rapture. At least the Frank Peretti-inspired The Visitation (which was itself a deeply flawed film) had an endgame that tied together the movie's premise. Unidentified ends nowhere even close to where it started  which is a huge letdown.  As for the acting? The supporting acting ranges from decent to awful. (Rebecca St. James plays a bit part and is passable.) For their part  a few of the main characters are manned capably enough. Sadly  their talents are wasted on characters so one-dimensional in their personalities so as to be unbelievable. The protagonists are anything but; you know it's bad when two Christian viewers find the most vocal Christian character in the film to be the most annoying.  A final note on the evangelistic tone of this movie  which will be of more interest to Christian than non-Christian readers. In a word  it is embarrassing. Other Christian films like Carmen's The Champion and Peretti's The Hangman's Curse have managed to communicate a genuinely uncompromising portrait of the Christian faith without sounding preachy or oppressive. This film  by contrast  is a sledgehammer that feels so heavy-handed and lacking in tact that a non-Christian would have a hard time taking it seriously.  I do believe that the filmmaker's heart is in the right place  and I applaud efforts to create good Christian film. Unfortunately  this is not one of them. If your church is looking for a screening of a good Christian film  consider Mercy Streets  the aforementioned The Champion  or (if you're Pentecostal) Robert Duvall's provocative The Apostle.   As for Unidentified? Rent it if you must  but screen it before you show it to a non-Christian or a larger audience.\n",

John Gielgud  howsoever brief his appearance in the movie  still seemed to be playing a role from Hamlet. The hard core pornography parts were neither erotic nor did they do much to further the story. Okay Malcolm McDowell had a nice butt and the guy who played Macro was handsome. The guy who played Claudius  looked more like the traditional depictions of Nero and was certainly at odds with Robert Graves' picture of Claudius. The climactic (?) assassination of Caligula  wife and child is inaccurate in that it shows him after death lying on stairs in an open-air area  when in fact he was assassinated in the underground passage on the palatine hill which ran along the front of the Domus Flaviana that still exists today.

In that black-comedy classic  two half-insane siblings mother their goofy younger brother as well  yet they do the killing there.

The `horror' in this early 70's film is very amateurish and cheap  but there are a few neat attempts to build up the tension.

Flora Robson  who may be recognized by classic film buffs  plays one of the sisters. She gave image to the Queen of England is the legendary Errol Flynn swashbuckler film  the Sea Hawk.\n",

      "The cast played Shakespeare.  Shakespeare lost.  I appreciate that this is trying to bring Shakespeare to the masses  but why ruin something so good.  Is it because 'The Scottish Play' is my favorite Shakespeare? I do not know. What I do know is that a certain Rev Bowdler (hence bowdlerization) tried to do something similar in the Victorian era.  In other words  you cannot improve perfection.  I have no more to write but as I have to write at least ten lines of text (and English composition was never my forte I will just have to keep going and say that this movie  as the saying goes  just does not cut it.\n",

      "In spite of its high-minded ambitions  Zurlini's film must be seen as a failure. It's one thing to create a world which draws the viewer into feeling the tedium and angst experienced by the protagonist (which I think is what Zurlini was attempting). It's another thing entirely to make a film that is itself tedious and meaninglessly episodic. Despite beautiful cinematography at a haunting location - and a wonderful score - the film never lures the audience in. Too much is unintentionally funny (the phony sound of dripping water in Drago's quarters  for example  or the silent-movie mugging by some of the actors) or simply confusing (Why exactly does Drago want to leave the fort the first time?) for the film to succeed as a coherent work.\n",

Unfortunately this was very hard to do with Samantha Morton.  The storyline seemed very disjointed and didn't flow as it should/could have done.

      "Woody Allen (who I have to confess at the outset I have never been a big fan of) directed this quasi-documentary about the life of Emmett Ray (Sean Penn)  a 1930's jazz guitarist whose star apparently shone for a while  then quickly faded. Penn does a credible job in the role  portraying a complicated and somewhat neurotic man (not unlike Allen himself  which perhaps explains why Woody would be attracted to this project) who can't maintain relationships  and whose twin passions (aside from guitar playing) were shooting rats at the dump and watching trains.  There isn't a great deal of consistency to the story. It's narrated in a sense by a series of modern-day jazz experts (one of whom is Allen himself)  who relate their various theories and interpretations of different events in Ray's life. The end result is a wildly inconsistent account of the life of a fictional man who seems to have been given a fairly interesting life story by his creators  who probably should have done a better job with it.   Jazz fans and fans of Woody Allen will probably enjoy this. As for me? The best I can give it is a 3/10.\n",

      "Boyle Heights  Los Angeles: legendary South American goat-sucking vampire  El Chupacabra  is on the loose  feeding on anyone unlucky enough to cross its path. Animal control officer Navarro (Eric Alegria) and Chupacabra expert/author Starlina Divide (Elina Madison) attempt to track down the creature  but find their progress hampered by a pair of dumb cops  money hungry locals keen to capture the beast for a fat reward  and a couple of nefarious scientists who want the monster for their experiments.  Stinking higher than a two-week-old taco  El Chupacabra is an incredibly bad horror movie that even fans of incredibly bad horror movies might struggle to sit through. With its dreadful script  awful direction (by not one  but two talentless hacksBrennon Jones and Paul Wynne)  laughable dialogue  and some of the worst acting this side of a porn flick  I recommend this film about as much as I do drinking the tap water in Mexico.  As Navarro and Starlina proceed with their investigations  viewers are treated to some incredibly weak gore  the worst designed book jacket in history  the most unconvincing dead person I've seen since the blinking corpse in Dr. Butcher MD  and a high-tech computerised security system consisting of a keyboard nailed to a post.  To be fair  for a guy in a rubber suit  the monster itself is fairly creepy (hairy  with big claws  and a face like a particularly ugly bat)  but its appearances are few and far between  with more screen time spent on the tedious trials and tribulations of whiney Officer Navarro than on the killer antics of the titular creature (just how many times is it necessary to see Navarro handing in paperwork to his bitchy boss?).  If  like me  you make the mistake of wasting your hard-earned cash on this dreadful latino bilge (in my case  it was a whole 50p)  consider using the disc as a coaster for your tequila rather than actually watching it.\n",

      "David Bryce's comments nearby are exceptionally well written and informative as almost say everything I feel about DARLING LILI. This massive musical is so peculiar and over blown  over produced and must have caused ruptures at Paramount in 1970. It cost 22 million dollars! That is simply irresponsible. DARLING LILI must have been greenlit from a board meeting that said hey we got that Pink Panther guy and that Sound Of Music gal... lets get this too and handed over a blank cheque. The result is a hybrid of GIGI  ZEPPELIN  HALF A SIXPENCE  some MGM 40s song and dance numbers of a style (daisies and boaters!) so hopelessly old fashioned as to be like musical porridge  and MATA HARI dramatics. The production is colossal  lush  breathtaking to view  but the rest: the ridiculous romance  Julie looking befuddled  Hudson already dead  the mistimed comedy  and the astoundingly boring songs deaden this spectacular film into being irritating. LILI is like a twee 1940s mega musical with some vulgar bits to spice it up. STAR! released the year before sadly crashed and now is being finally appreciated for the excellent film is genuinely is... and Andrews looks sublime  mature  especially in the last half hour......but LILI is POPPINS and DOLLY frilly and I believe really killed off the mega musical binge of the 60s..... and made Andrews look like Poppins again... which I believe was not Edwards intention. Paramount must have collectively fainted when they saw this: and with another $20 million festering in CATCH 22  and $12 million in ON A CLEAR DAY and $25 million in PAINT YOUR WAGON....they had a financial abyss of CLEOPATRA proportions with $77 million tied into 4 films with very uncertain futures. Maybe they should have asked seer Daisy Gamble from ON A CLEAR DAY ......LILI was very popular on immediate first release in Australia and ran in 70mm cinemas for months but it failed once out in the subs and the sticks and only ever surfaced after that on one night stands with ON A CLEAR DAY as a Sunday night double. Thank god Paramount had their simple $1million (yes  ONE MILLION DOLLAR) film LOVE STORY and that $4 million dollar gangster pic THE GODFATHER also ready to recover all the $77 million in just the next two years....for just $5m.... incredible!\n",

      "I read the book after seeing the movie and didn't care for it  finding it somewhat trashy; but trashy books often make good movies  and this one certainly could have. The story of a teen girl's exploration of her attractive power over boys  which she finds as irresistibly stimulating as it is doubtfully controllable  and which has an even tighter grip on her than it would on a normal girl because it affects her through her werewolfry--this story would have an obvious appeal to the young audience for which movies are made: an appeal of one kind to girls  and of another kind to boys: and I don't understand how the movie makers could be blind to that and turn the story into one with little appeal to anybody.  To begin with  take the title (which is the best thing about the book): it's drawn from a Hesse quotation  also used as an epigraph  about a person running in fear and tasting both blood and chocolate in his mouth  one tasting as bad as the other. This is a wonderful metaphor for the heroine's state: torn between her human and wolf sides  savoring each but equally fearful of both. The movie dispenses with the epigraph  and instead introduces the character working in her aunt's chocolate shop! I can understand how the book's title might have suggested to the movie makers the erotically charged chocolates of Like Water for Chocolate  and led them to want to link the same symbol to werewolves. But they didn't; so why is it in the movie? In the book the characters are in high school--or in and out  as with the Five  a teen gang who favor black jeans and T-shirts  and fall somewhere between being the heroine's nemeses and her pet peeves. In the movie they've become decadent twenty-something clubgoers. In the book the heroine is 16  just of an age to be discovering how her sexuality operates on the boy she wants  as well as on herself; she's the one who initiates the contact  then steps back  re-initiates  and so on. In the movie she's no longer a girl but a woman  and the guy is no longer a high school poet on the fringe of campus life but a fugitive from the law (and a comic book artist  to boot)  it's he who comes on to her  in a manner as unattractive as that of her wormy cousin. She initially puts him off  but then gives in  as he's confident she will: hey  you know you want it. I would have thought a female director would have taken the chance the book offered to show a female protagonist in an uncompliant  proactive role; but no.  In the book the heroine's clan is driven from their home because of the Five's delinquent behavior; in the movie it's because she went for a run(!). She's a great runner  prone to kicking off from building walls  and both she and her clanmates scale buildings in a trice; very like heroes of martial arts movies and very unlike wolves  or anything resembling them. In the book they don't turn into actual wolves  but things bigger than wolves; in the movie they're just ordinary wolves. In the book they metamorphose in Howling style  with crunching of spines; this is one of the things that make the heroine aware of the pain her body brings her  as well as the pleasure. In the movie the werewolves have become magical acrobats  taking great swan dives and transforming in mid-air  shimmering yellow like Tinker-Bell; it looks cool  means nothing.  In the book the clan is a slightly white-trashy family that has relocated from West Virginia to Maryland. In the movie they live in Bucharest but all talk in different accents  none Romanian. In the book nearly the whole pack want to lead normal lives and agree that to insure that--and indeed  their survival--one necessity is to keep their true nature secret from humans. And so the characters keep saying in the movie; yet the head of the clan is some kind of underground boss--but apparently not a crime boss  since he despises criminals--and has a standing deal with the police  who supply him with meat for the pack. This seems a big exception to the rule of keeping humans from knowing; but maybe the police are considered safe because of their known tolerance for eccentricity and cult murder.  At the end of the book the heroine learns she can't be something she's not when  in her effort to live a divided life  she gets stuck between the human and animal states  unable to be all one thing or the other. Her boyfriend isn't sure or strong enough to accept her for what she is  the pack can't risk having him around  and the two are forced to separate. In the movie she rescues him like Lassie  and they drive off to Paris (why Paris?)  in an ending that's smiley-faced but not really happy  since the conflicts between their natures--between _her_ natures--remain unresolved.  But the difference in the movie that hampers enjoyment the most is that whereas the book characters behave conventionally  within the realm of young adult novels  those in the movie for some reason have been made as annoying as possible. Every other line is a threat or some other kind of oneupsmanship: you'll be sorry; you don't belong here; you won't get rid of me; I gave you your chance; etc. I prefer to steer clear of people who deal in that way.  There have been many good vampire movies  never a good werewolf movie. Had this one stuck to the book  it might have been the first.  But no.\n",

There's really no other way for me to say it and I just can't stretch it enough. The only good thing about the whole thing was the woman that played Jamie Kennedy's wife who was hot but apart from her there's is nothing about this movie that is worth watching. I know it's meant for kids and that's why it's so idiotic but what about the adults that have to take their kids to watch this trash. Why do we have to suffer through this vile vomit sack of horrid crap. The original mask was a very good movie that had a great mix of comedy and great story telling. This one is a lame attempt by hack filmmakers to cash in on the franchise and judging by the laughable BO gross I'm guessing the franchise won't go on any longer.  -The cinematographer needs to be beaten severely because the sugary colors of the movie will make you feel like throwing up. If there was music  I didn't pay attention to it because I had already punctured my eardrums to prevent myself from hearing the horrid dialog. Then there's the acting or at least what passes for acting nowadays. you could watch an infomercial and see much better acting in that than the one in this movie but I can't really blame the actors since it's the director who deserves the blame for apparently not realizing that the actors needed to do another f**king take. If new line is looking to start a franchise with this then they need to up their game by hiring writers that can actually write and stop thinking that the audience will watch any crap that comes out   -Bottom line if you're a sadomasochistic and you love torturing yourself then please by all means check this out because it is painful to watch but if you're not and you actually like to watch movies that are good then avoid at all cost\n",

It turns out the sister is part of a Jim Jones type religous cult in New Guinea. She hires a scruffy guide played by Robert Kerman to help her get to the cult's compound located in the jungle. This is another (!) cannibal movie  and I probably would have liked it if not for Lenzi padding this film out with scenes from his superior The Man from Deep River. I mean every cannibal scene is directly lifted from this film  which I guess makes him about as credible as Al Adamson. I felt ripped off. ***SPOILER*** 1/2 star and that's for the dildo scene.\n",

      "Rivalry between brothers leads to main story line. Navy Commander Chuck Prescott(Marshall Thompson)has developed the Y12 aircraft to test how far man can go up in the atmosphere. His brother  Lt. Dan Prescott(Bill Edwards)  seems to be the best test pilot around and is chosen to go up in the Y12. Dan of course has a problem with taking orders and is also an over confident dare devil.   On Dan's second flight  he hits over the 300 miles up comfort zone and his craft passes through a meteor dust storm. Returning to earth  Dan becomes a monster that resembles 200 pounds of bad asphalt. He also has a demanding craving for blood  whether it be from farm animals or fellow human beings.  Short runtime of an hour and seventeen minutes; black & white with near stoic acting...typical of low budget sci-fi.  Rounding out the cast is Marla Landi  Robert Ayers and Carl Jaffe. Noteworthy trivia: about two months after this film was released; the Russians put the real first man in space.\n",

      "This can hardly be called a good movie  actually it's not even close. But I have to say  that there was a few things that made me... not laugh  not giggle  but something like that. The Resovoir Dogs parody was one of them. The rest are not important enough to be remembered.  To be honest  I was a little disappointed by this movie. The plot sounded like an idea  but it quickly fell to the ground. The whole thing was just to messy and the actors where not good for the characters; most of them simply overacted. There was also a whole lot of unessecary sequences  that was a total waste of film. I do realize that it would make the movie about 20 min shorter  but it would only make it better.  Now  with the good and the bad things lined up  let's go to the conclusion: two out of six toilet seats up for this one.\n",

At the 15 minute mark   I was begiing the others to let me rip the DVD out and fling it back to the rental store  but they refused. They swore it had to get better.  They were wrong! This movie was lacking everything. The actors delivered their lines with as much emotion as a comatose rock! The plot was ridiculous and I was offended that Hollywood assumed people were dumb enough to enjoy it. None of the characters interacted very well with each other. Ice-T gives one of his worst performances here.  After watching footage of the wrong plane  bad guys standing up to get shot  and clips being emptied and missing everything  I wanted to scream and bang my head on concrete. The movie hit its plateau of ignorance when the people on the space station used an elevator to travel. Space suits are not needed and there is gravity in space regardless of what real astronauts may say.  I didn't finish this movie and hated it. I don't want to finish this movie. This is slow suicide.

      "Young couple on the road  minding their own business and having casual sex in their car during broad daylight. Yet  suddenly  they're being menaced and terrorized by a deranged psychopath in an old and rusty pick-up truck. Hmm  where have I seen this premise before? Oh yeah  now I remember  we've seen this a THOUSAND times before already  and approximately nine hundred and ninety-nine of the other cases were much better than Rest Stop! This weak and pitiable new movie is insulting even to the intellect of the most undemanding horror fans  as it doesn't feature a single original twist or memorable gimmick. It's very sadistic and nasty  but every teenkill-slasher flick is sadistic and nasty nowadays  so that's no real surprise anymore  neither. The absolute main problem with this production is the incredibly large amount of dumb plot holes and meaningless sub plots. Writer/director John Shiban damn well realized that the ultra-thin basic storyline nearly wasn't enough to fill a whole movie with  and thus he stuffs up his film like a Thanksgiving turkey with imbecile and nonsensical padding material. Nicole's boyfriend vanishes at an abandoned and filthy rest stop in California. Killing off her character right away wouldn't result in a very long movie and thus she subsequently encounters a motor home family of freaks  suffers from visions (?) in which she talks to the deranged killer's previous victims and she has deeply emotional (and boring) conversations with a police officer who just won't die even though a truck ran over him...twice! The dumb sub plots never lead anywhere and they're definitely the most pathetic and desperate attempts to stretch a movie's length I've ever seen. Instead of all the pointless padding  Shiban should have paid more attention to building up tension and make his lead characters a little more likable. Jaimie Alexander's character Nicole is an annoying and brainless girl  and you won't really care whether she'll survive the ordeal or not. Her boyfriend Jesse as well as the cop are both whining losers and their brutal deaths still weren't painful enough  if you ask me. I counted exactly three sequences  all including torture and gratuitous mutilation  that were gory and exciting enough to bring a sadist smile on my face. That's still way too few for a nowadays horror movie. Basically  Rest Stop is simply a miserable attempt to cash in on the success of such films like Wolf Creek and Hostel  but you're better off watching the originals. This was the first film of the new production company called 'Raw Feed'. They're promoting themselves as the new name in great horror  but they'll have to come up with something much better than Rest Stop if they want us to believe that.\n",

      "I happened to catch this movie on late night TV. I saw the opening credits and thought this looks good. Well I was very wrong. While not excruciatingly bad (it had some funny and tender moments)it lacked any sense of cohesion.  It started off well enough with Kathy Bates'character having a midlife crisis of sorts when her husband leaves her and her singing idol is murdered. But Kathy has played these disaffected women so well before - think Fried Green Tomatoes. The problem wasn't Kathy  it was the clueless screenplay that wandered all over the place. It was as if the writers must have been thinking what will we do next. The script also felt very contrived.  Some others who have posted comments on this movie have wondered why it didn't receive a cinematic release. The main reason I think would have been to avoid embarrassment and the critics would have murdered it.  Having said all that I thought the small woman who played Maudie was fantastic and stole the movie  not to mention how beautiful she is.\n",

      "This movie is... horrible and wonderful at the same time. I first saw it when I was about 13 or 14 years old  so it has a great deal of nostalgic value for me. In this movie  Cesar Romero actually plays the character of Octavio  the man who discovered Santana. There are also two other actors  Monte Markham (plays Sam  who is trying to save his daughter) and Peter Mark Richman (plays the priest)  who have large filmographies  and these are the only performances that are okay. The rest of the acting and the movie itself have all of the B-film qualities that some of us cherish.  I recently spent 2 years trying to acquire a copy of this movie  and it is almost nonexistent. I am assuming that it was discontinued very shortly after its release. But I did eventually find a copy and paid a pretty penny to acquire it. If you happen to come upon Judgement Day in a video store (unmistakeable with a cheesy green satan on the cover)  count yourself among the blessed who live near one of the few video stores that still has a working copy. A must see for those of you who like to laugh at cheesy attempts at a scary movie.\n",

      "The biggest problem with In Search of Historic Jesus is that there is very little search to it at all. Shick-Sunn produced these documentary films in the 1970s and just into the '80s  which featured interviews with experts and discussion of science and facts to make a case for whatever the title of the film was looking to cash in on.  Sadly  Historic Jesus is really little more than a third-rate dramatization of the life of Christ. Unlike Shick-Sunn's more superior In Search of Noah's Ark which spends the majority of its running time discussing the possibility that the ark is resting on the earth today and where that might be  this film is basically the story of Jesus with no effort made to prove or disprove his existence. The famed Shroud of Turrin is mentioned  but little other detective work is given much screen time.  For fans of these quasi-documentary films like Jupiter Menace and In Search of Bigfoot  etc.  this movie doesn't offer much.\n",

      "I used to work at the company that originally put out this film  Vestron Pictures. Vestron had the same problem that a lot of small independent film companies had  they didn't have a lot of money to put into the production values of their films. Not that money alone will buy you a good film. Look at Kevin Costner's Waterworld  for instance.  Sometimes  if you have a talented person in-house doing the acquisitions or development  you can create your own new talent. But at Vestron  there wasn't such a person and they always skimped in some crucial area. In this case  it was on the director and the writer. Which makes it pretty hard to have a decent movie  even with the great ensemble cast this film has.  I think the basic premise of this movie was Let's put a bunch of quirky characters in a room and see if anything interesting happens. It's an intriguing idea  but not worth your time watching.  Most Vestron films ended up having a very distinctive look and feel to them. My wife and I developed the ability to spot this quality even in non-Vestron films. Many times  we were even able to spot that quality from watching only the trailer or TV ad. We'd sit there  watching the trailer or ad  and afterwards  we'd turn to each  and almost in sync  we'd say  Now that's a Vestron movie! This is a Vestron movie.\n",

A patchwork of film  video  and what appears to be stock footage combine to make a three-hour tour of one chapter of James A. Michener's epic novel. Well  the time period covered was one chapter  but I don't remember many of the situations actually occurring in the book. The packaging on my copy of the movie gives Maria Conchita Alonso top billing - though it turns out that she is only in one speaking scene. On the second tape.  The actors are to be commended for playing their roles well  despite a smarmy  overwrought script. They are to be insulted  though  for accepting the roles in the first place.\n",

She also does a bit of fighting and a bit of shooting  but not nearly as much as I was hoping for. The film is extremely slow-moving and low-budgeted  though at least they tried to find an excuse for the spaceship being so underpopulated; nearly the entire crew is on suspended animation  and the ship moves on auto pilot! And the heroine doesn't rescue any of them  or bring anything useful back home; it seems that tricking that evil lady into traveling through space was the only part of her mission that couldn't be more easily accomplished by the missiles that blow up the ship at the end. There are also some long but rather tame soft-core scenes  and a couple of Alien-rip-off monsters that kill about 2 people. *1/2 out of 4.\n",

However  the dog appears to be drowning when Hunnicutt jumps in after him. It becomes obvious pretty soon that despite Hunnicutt and his dog roaming about after leaving the water that they both died in the water--as no one responds when he talks to them and sees and hears people talking about his and the dog's death. Yet  oddly  Hunnicutt is REALLY slow on the uptake and it takes him a while to understand they are talking about him! I think this was actually done as padding  as there really wasn't enough material to fill the half hour time slot.  Later  in the surprise twist  he comes upon Heaven--or at least his concept of the place. He's invited in  but since they won't allow dogs  he has other ideas! Overall  reasonably well acted but of dubious spiritual value! With no twists or irony  this episode is a bit dull--not Twilight Zone-y enough for my tastes.\n",

But when the main character allies with whoever happens to have the most fish at the moment  mostly by having sex with them and playing the role of the constant victim  my anger just rises to a whole new level. Take two guys (a husband and another man)  put a pure bombshell woman in the middle of them  ad a deserted island  subtract all her moral issues  ad a whole bunch of moral issues to the men and mix it in a big bowl of arguments  fish and a zippo lighter and you will come up with a piece of junk movie like this.   The acting is  I would say  good. There are some bloopers but not many as far as i could see. The main female character makes me sick. This is due to her lack of moral values. The man with the most fish get's her attention. Even though one of them is her husband  she sees no problem with being unfaithful with (Manuel) the other man because I must do it to survive. How can you justify having sex with another man for fish when your husband is 30feet away? And he won't even benefit from it? The female character has absolutely no problems to justify anything that she does. If she doesen't get approval for her actions  she's a victim.  I recommend everyone to see this movie. This is the kind of movie that will make just about everything else you see this year a pleasant movie experience.\n",

      ". . . and that is only if you like the sight of beautiful woman with nice  bouncy jugs running around the so called African jungle. So no problems there for most males out there.  I watched it as one of those bundled together package. Forget about the plot which is essentially just a flimsy storyline to get our heroine flashing her jugs on screen at every opportunity possible. Just to give you a sense  our heroine swings from vine to vine and climb on top animals at every chance possible for no good reason at all just to let you see her jugs at all angles. Again  no complaints.  The fight scenes are laughable and borderline on the pornographic. Our heroine got caught by the baddies at least five times in the movie. On occasions when she has to fight  the fighting involves rolling around in the dirt  grunting unconvincingly and basically fighting like kittens. I am surprised no hair pulling is involved. It get so bad that the chief baddie had to remind the combatants that I said  the one that draw first blood wins! in order to avoid watching anymore stupid fighting.  The witch doctor Kuku was a bloody blast. From being a big  cuddly bear in the beginning  he became manic depressive when captured and then  outright psycho. He spent the whole movie muttering lines with no irrelevance.  Beside Liana (our heroine)bouncing around topless  you also get to see plenty of other Amazonians as well as one woman who decided to jump naked into the lake to take a swim for no good reasons. Yeah  it is that kind of movie.  Watch the beautiful Liane in her bouncy glory. Despite the movie being more than 20 years old  the allure of watching blond women flashing their nice jugs on screen never gets old.\n",

This silly little film about an 11 year-old who carries a gun  steals cars  robs stores  burglars houses  extorts money from other kids  burns houses  shoots rats  buys drugs  distributes drugs to his mother and his friends  and then kills a guy. What a great comedy! But it wasn't intended to be a comedy. It was intended as a social drama. How can this be? The events in this film are absurd and ridiculous. The characters are all stereotypes right out of a 4 year-old's comic-strip-induced immature imagination. The dialog is laughable; people talk like morons. It's a very dumb film.  The first scenes are indeed very funny  for all the wrong reasons. But the unintentional hilarity of the idiotic premise runs out after a short while  and after that the laughs come only rarely; by that time the viewer can't believe what he is seeing and is alternately amazed and bored by what follows (if he has at least half a brain cell).  A short film  but feels like an eternity. The film actually IS a seriously-intended attempt to show the world of a young degenerate  while imitating movies vastly superior to it  like Fun. There is just such an air of phoniness about everything; the kids  the adults  everyone lacks credibility both in their actions and dialog. The kid in the lead mugs his way through the film as though he had seen all the Jimmy Cagney movies at least a hundred times. And  typically enough  the kid isn't portrayed as a reservoir of evil  but  instead  as a misunderstood little artistic talent. But of course. Every young hooligan is misunderstood - society made him bad. Poor child.  The film is embarrassing; a collection of stale  occasionally hilarious clichés put together to make a movie that lacks intelligence and meaning. The intellectual level of the film is zero.\n",

      "Kazuo Komizu  who hasn't made one decent film  directed this notorious shocker and should be ashamed that it was a hit upon its Japanese release.  Yes  it does feature scenes of rape  gore and dismemberment  but so what? It has the style of a bad American porn film shot and badly photographed by Ed Powers (Dirty Debutantes) and is incredibly slow.  It seems to have earned its notoriety based on its roster of anti-social acts.  There is a huge difference between this and horror that is well produced.  Just because someone likes their cinema a little wet does not mean they'll accept crap like this. On the contrary  that kind of fan (myself  for example) tolerates even less crap than the average punter out there because he's seen so much and has become overly discerning. It's a shame production companies don't realize that.  One reviewer here (ZombieKilla81) commented that the film's near obsession with gang rape is one of the factors that killed it. I disagree. The subject matter is never the issue. The issue is how that subject matter is treated. In ENTRAILS OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN  it is treated so unimaginatively that it is boring.  Personally  I like graphic depictions of psychopathic behavior (with an intriguing context) if the material is well directed  freshly photographed and aesthetically pleasing.

With the exception of several of his very early ones which are not available  I have actually seen just about all of them  so it's obvious I am a big fan and it's certain that I have a high tolerance for the gross and irreverent in his films. While way over the top and disgusting  I adored FEMALE TROUBLE and POLYESTER--two monumental tributes to bad taste and excess that are seriously funny films. So I am certainly NOT squeamish and can take most of what Waters has to offer. However  in PINK FLAMINGOS he has created a film so repellent  so unfunny and so offensive that I couldn't even stand it. In his other films he made before he became more mainstream  they were funny. Yet here  the humor just isn't there as it seems the intent is to shock the viewers and not entertain them in any way. I am glad that after making this film  Waters' sense of humor improved  as Divine consuming dog feces (as in this film) is shocking but not the least bit entertaining. My advice is to skip this film and just pretend it never happened and then watch his infinitely better films of the 70s and 80s.\n",

      "Technically abominable (with audible pops between scenes)and awesomely amateurish  Flesh requires a lot of patience to sit through and will probably turn off most viewers; but the dialogue rings amazingly true and Joe Dallesandro  who exposes his body in almost every scene  also gives an utterly convincing performance. A curio  to be sure  but the more polished Trash  made two years later  is a definite step forward. I suggest you watch that instead. (*1/2)\n",

      "Marlene Dietrich is magnificent as Concha Perez  the temptress who drives all men to despair in Josef Von Sternberg's The Devil is a Woman. Her performance has nothing to do with 'acting' in any conventional sense but she's incandescent  a true star in full command of her material. But she's the only good thing about the film  (she's so good she keeps you watching this dross; I doubt if any other actress could have done the same).  The story is an appallingly lame melodrama  (surely Pierre Louys' novel was better)  in which Dietrich's amoral Concha ruins the lives of two friends played by Lionel Atwill and Cesar Romero with a stiffness bordering on petrification. And for Von Sternberg it's an ugly looking movie  (maybe in keeping with its fairly ugly subject matter). Bunuel  on the other hand  thought enough of it to remake it as That Obscure Object of Desire with a greater emphasis on the surrealist aspects of it all  down to casting two different actresses in the same role. Neither film is either director's finest hour and while the Bunuel version may be the better film  it is Dietrich's 'performance' you remember.\n",

      "It is a truism that it takes a lot of effort to make a bad movie - this one is no exception.  I am no lover of yanks but their amazingly simplistic view of the world and their ability to reduce everything to black and white as well as make events (even fictional ones in novels) fit an agenda that bears little or no relationship to complexity of any kind is irritating in the extreme.  Wilbur Smith is descriptively verbose but weaves intricate tales that deserve more than has been delivered by this awful mishmash of a movie.  Sad really for those who will never read Smith. They will be left with a less than decent portrayal of his Egyptian series  which has to be said is gigantic in its exposition.  The Indiana Jones movies were snappy. To attempt to replicate that by manipulating Smith's novels into this production misses out by a country mile.  Pathetic except for the photography and Art Malik.\n",

      "Detective Sergent Vince De Carlo (James Luisi) and company are on the case of a vicious Serial Killer/Rapist. Can Psychologist Carol (Susan Sullivan) help  or will she become the killer's next victim? And what is with the killer's hilarious White Dude Afro?   Inspired by the case of serial killer Ted Bundy  Killer's Delight aka The Dark Ride is a rather dull Serial Killer tale from 1978 that doesn't offer much. If anything  it's more of a police procedural flick than a horror movie  as much of the violence occurs off camera. Sure  we get mutilated bodies  but we don't get a whole lot in the exploitation department-especially considering that they are from the aftermath  and not during the crime. Those hoping for the likes of The Toolbox Murders or Maniac will be very disappointed.  Fortunately  there is an impressive scene involving a woman trying to escape the killer that get's the tone right  and is quite suspenseful to boot. Also  John Karlen is quite effective as the killer  though his hilarious hairstyle (white guys with Afros are always worth a chuckle) is more than a bit distracting.  The Dark Ride is too routine and mediocre to really warrant a recommendation  as it lacks the proper exploitation elements  and is dated even by the standards of the time. Those looking for a better example should probably turn to Don't Go In The House and a few others instead  as this just doesn't cut it.\n",

      "I cannot see why anyone would make such a movie. From start to finish this film is really  really bad.  The characters are all very shallow  terribly acted and downright annoying. There is absolutely nothing going on below the surface at all with either characters or plot.  The 'humour' if you can call it that is aimed at an adult audience ( I presume from the language and nudity) although it comes across as mainly toilet humour and would have problems even drawing a smile from a half-witted 16 year old.  I would recommend avoiding this excuse for a comedy. It has nothing whatsoever that would appeal to a film fan. Non-existent laughs and a plot that barely exists lead me to ask Why has this film been made  why  why  why?  I expect in the fullness of time to see this film topping the top 100 worst films.\n",

      "I've seen about a half dozen of the low budget poverty row B westerns that Ken Maynard made in the 1930s  and I am consistently amazed at how poor an actor he was. How did he ever get to be a leading cowboy actor? They say that he could ride pretty well back in the silents  but he doesn't do anything particularly impressive in these later sound films. Still  maybe he got the leads because he was big and could ride.  Phantom Rancher isn't as bad as some of the other Ken Maynard films I've seen  but it still isn't much. Some of the other characters refer to him a couple of times as a young fella  where it appears to me that he's just as old as the other older actors.  And if that's not silly enough  there's a rather significant script problem in this film. At one point  one of the characters makes a remark about how the phantom had prevented the poisoning of a well  something that hadn't happened yet. Just a couple of minutes later  we then see that particular scene. No  it wasn't a flashback. At first I thought perhaps that when Treeline Films was doing the DVD transfer  they might have reversed two of the reels. But in those days film reels contained approximately 11 minutes of film  and the whole reversal only took about 3 or 4 minutes tops. Everything else was in a logical order. So  it looks like that was a genuine continuity problem in the original film. Maybe that's one reason why Colony Pictures didn't last very long.\n",

      "This movie shows what you can create if you have a camera  some spare paint and cardboard a toy ship  a few friends who acted in community theater  and the incorrect notion you can make a film. The end result is an unwatchable time-waster that you'll skip through  unless you take it out of the DVD player and toss it through the window first.  The acting in the opening scene (especially by the rotund Lee Morgan as 'Captain') and the toy ship crashing into the rocks before the credits is a good indicator of what you're in for (with all the foam  it looks like this special effect was shot in a kitchen sink. I guess Boyette figured he save some cash by washing the dishes at the same time). In terms of bad cinema  the funny thing is Dungeon of Harrow seems to have inspired (maybe by coincidence) the twist ending of Manos: The Hands of Fate. Yep  it's the same lame I was the victim  and now I take the mad villain's place ironic ending. The bigger irony is that two inept  talentless filmmakers could make two equally-wretched  Texas-filmed horror movies and get away with it.  Monotone nerd Russ Harvey is a noble in a great family line (why they were great is never broached)  boring us while lamenting the death of his family line and crest before his ship even crashes (we're also treating to a droning narration throughout the film). Sadly  we aren't so lucky. His family's toy ship crashes into some styrofoam in a sink  and he's washed ashore with his bloated captain and some woman  conveniently deposited on a mad Count's island.  Meanwhile  the Count is visited by an evil spirit who  dressed in a Blackstone's Magic Kit outfit  assaults him with various puppets (spiders  snakes  bats. . . all the icky stuff). The Count (William McNulty) overacts worse than Shatner and has a visibly difficult time keeping a straight face through the typical madman ranting.  I'd be mad too if I had to be in this disaster. The woman is promptly killed by the Count's ferocious dogs  and the two jerks are captured by his manservant. The Count accuses them of being pirates (apparently his worst fear)  he slaps his manservant around a lot (apparently his greatest joy)  Fatboy gets tortured  there's a woman who's a servant and one who's a nurse  the rotting leper hag-in-a-wedding-dress Countess in the dungeon (she digs the Nerdy Noble and is the only effective & creepy thing in the movie)  a lot of inane dialogue at a dining room table  the blubbery Captain gets killed while making a pathetic getaway (aking to watching a sloth battle a pack of lions). . . it's all an ugly haze to me. I spent most of my time on the fast-forward button.  Anyway  the jerk noble and nurse make a getaway and think they're going to be rescued by three guys in a rowboat on the lake (yeah  we're supposed to believe a lake is the ocean). They don't  since the nerd's hair turned gray and he scares the would-be rescuers away. Honestly  I think they simply took the opportunity to row away from this hideous film while the had the chance. They head back to the castle  the nurse starts rotting like the Countess (and your stomach  by this time)  and we end with these two getting ready to descend into the . . . DUNGEON OF HARROW!!!! Blech!  I love old  lousy horror films  but they must have some sort of entertainment value. I feel ripped off  even at the low low price of $5.99 for this biscuit. Mystery Science Theater would have a tough time making this one fun. I was taken in by a few nutty reviewers who claimed this film had atmosphere and some creepy moments. Wrong! Avoid this tripe at all costs  and don't even waste a buck if you find it in a dollar bin somewhere. This movie makes Corman's The Terror like like a masterpiece of horror and atmosphere.\n",

      "Every time I watch this movie blood comes gushing out of my eyes. Yes  you read that correctly: I've watched this wretched  foul thing more than once.  Caddyshack 2 went wrong for so many reasons: Harold Ramis dialing in a script and abandoning the direction duties  Rodney Dangerfield (wisely) walking away from the project because they wouldn't allow him to tinker with the script  Bill Murray showing excellent judgement and not being part of it  and a puppet being pushed forward as the feature player of a cast who deserved much better.  I can't help but think of Dyan Cannon in this and wonder why she's perpetually laughing and smiling. The only conclusion I can draw is that she is indeed the face of pure evil. Stay with me a moment. She must have been watching as the film came together and revelled in the untold agony that it would inflict on countless soon to be extremely sorry movie goers who would have this film inflicted on them. She may also have been extremely drunk. That's what I need to be right now to wash the foul taste of this complete and utter failure out of my mind. If I'm lucky it'll be washed out forever.  I have seen this film several times. I blame several of them on childhood and being a very dull and dim-witted boy who apparently had no aesthetic sensibility. Perhaps puppets are just funnier when you're a kid. No  the Muppet show is funnier now ... guess I was just dull. Caddyshack 2 is that rare kind of film that is so extraordinarily disappointing on so many levels that you convince yourself after the end credits that it couldn't have been as bad as all that. It WAS. It IS. It will only get worse with time.  My reasons for going back to this film  mercifully  are becoming fewer. Randy Quaid is limited in his role as Jackie Mason's lawyer. His opening scene isn't bad and brought out my only chuckle. We see him a few more times but it becomes as tired as the rest of the movie and descends with unfortunate rapidity from incidentally amusing to vapid wasteland. Randy Quaid acquits himself well  and this film owes him big time because if there was reason to watch this film as anything other than a torture tactic  he was it.  Maybe that's the trick of the movie. It has enough potentially endearing qualities that people watch it  are horrified at what they've done to themselves but later because the pickings were so slim can remember only what did actually amuse them. Years later they unwittingly watch it again and the cycle repeats.  Jackie Mason takes a lot of the blame for this film but in fairness  I'm not sure he deserves it. He's really trying out there but it is impossible to not to notice that he spends the entire movie doing a Rodney Dangerfield impersonation. That's who the movie was written for but I'm not sure even he could have saved it. Ultimately this fails miserably through terrible direction  bad editing (shall we count continuity errors?) and a rehashing of the same story with none of the wry humour or heart that made the first film endearing.  Dragged kicking and screaming up to a three out of ten instead of two by Randy Quaid's bulldog determination. It isn't even bad enough to laugh at. I've definitely seen worse  but trust your memory -- this one is a dog. If you've never seen it you've made excellent life choices and I salute your excellent judgement.\n",

      "At the Earth's Core was on television yesterday. I was at my computer working and happened to glance over and see what must have been some of the worst action sequences ever made. I was instantly enthralled by the film's shoddy production values  appalling acting (by all included -- even Peter Cushing) and horrific  unintentionally hilarious action sequences and puppet-monsters.  The film is about a Victorian scientist who takes a stereotypical Buff American Hero on a ground-boring trip in the Welsh countryside. Little do they know that a great evil lurks at the center of the earth's core....  Forget the fact that the title doesn't make sense. (If they were really at the earth's core  they'd be about 2700 kg/m3 underground and burning alive in a sea of iron or whatever it is down there.) Forget that the puppets used in the production rival The Beast Master for being the fakest-looking of all-time. No  the real genius of At the Earth's Core is its naive stupidity -- a gung-ho action spectacle without real action and without real spectacle. It is in essence just a gung-ho movie and a stupid one at that. People who enjoy MST3K-style stuff will love this -- it's appallingly bad  and indeed so bad it is almost enjoyable in a strange way.\n",

I felt anger just watching that one scene  and how they were so badly made out in the film. The humor lasts just for one laugh  and then you don't understand why it's even funny.

      "I've got to say  I'm a big fan of these 'Last House on the Left' rip-offs  even the ones that most people seem to hate are often held in relatively high esteem by me; but one of these sorts of films that I didn't like much was Aldo Lado's 'Night Train Murders'  and unfortunately it would seem that trains and The Last House on the Left don't mix  as Terror Express is another lacklustre rip-off. Something that this sort of film really needs is a resoundingly nasty lead character; and while Terror Express offers up three potential candidates  not one of them steps up and becomes this villain  leaving the lacking in the most important area. It actually gets off to a good start as three young men on a passenger train begin slightly irritating the guests on board. This leads the audience to believe that there is more in store  but unfortunately it never really gets going once the scene has been set. From there  the trio end up 'taking over' the train and use their new found power to terrorise the guests and rape the women.  It has to be said that there's a fair amount of sleaze in this film  which will be pleasing to many viewers; but there's hardly any blood. Director Ferdinando Baldi seemed to think that he could get away with replacing the blood with sex scenes  and he may have gotten away with it too; if he could film a brutal sex scene. The idea that these men have taken the train by force goes out of the window once it gets to the sex  as the people that you would expect to be powerful and forceful seem all too keen to show their women a good time  and despite one very tame 'sandwich' sequence  none of the sex is particularly interesting. Since a lot of the film is taken up by these sex scenes  this becomes a massive problem. Films like this are often lacking in style  suspense and credibility; but you know you're watching a bad one when it's boring you. As you might expect  none of the acting is up to anything; and the central three in particular stand out for being rubbish. The direction is lacking in style  and there's very little tension or suspense; making it difficult to care what is going to happen. Overall  this is a pretty crappy example of an exploitation film  and I can't recommend it.\n",

Does House of the Dead 2 do any of these things right? No  not one. Of course  its not as bad as its predecessor  from Uwe Bowle and thats the only thing about this movie that scares me.

The army base in this movie  is a parking garage  with a desk and a open gated room. This movie is so low budget that they couldn't even get co-ed locker rooms. In fact it seems like this entire movie was filmed in a middle school.  Also  why is it that the all the female soldiers in this movie are models?

      "Yet again  I appear to be the only person on planet Earth who is capable of criticizing Japanese films made before 1970. Fires on the Plain (1959) is another in the seemingly endless line of classics that get all sorts of praise for no apparently good reason. As much as I love to overgeneralize and psychoanalyze all of these moviegoers who have such horrible taste in film  it's still nearly impossible to rationalize why anyone would ever think that poorly made fluff like this should be proclaimed as some sort of masterpiece. What I find truly ironic is that fans of derivative classics like Fires on the Plain focus so much on inside the box movie-making (orthodox grading standards like scriptwriting  acting  camera-work  etc.) yet it always seems like the most highly revered classics are most deficient in these very standards. For example  one of the laziest copouts for a filmmaker involves forced verbal exposition where characters basically explain everything for the viewer even when the constructed scenario is totally artificial. Most surprisingly  the very first scene in Fires on the Plain uses this indolent tactic to the extreme.  After a funny head slap  the following useless dialogue assaults the viewer  Why can't you grasp the situation? We landed to the west under heavy fire to reinforce units at Tacloban. We lost two-thirds of our men. Our artillery was sunk in transit. We tried to reach Burauen airfield by crossing the central mountains but without artillery it was impossible. The enemy's counterattack forced a fanout across the valley. You know that. So why  exactly  is one character telling another character something he already knows? Oh yeah  that's right  the makers of this film are too lazy to think of more natural ways to communicate this information. You see  a quality film would actually show these events happening  or at worst it would involve dialogue involving one character who has no knowledge of those events. Heck  even an opening summary in paragraph form directed at the viewer would have been better than what transpired here.  Such instances of poor quality movie-making are littered throughout Fires on the Plain to the point where this film feels like it was written by imbeciles for imbeciles. For example  the lead character stumbles upon some skeletons wrapped in Japanese garb. Instead of doing the natural thing like  oh I don't know  giving a depressed mannerism  the character blurts out Japanese soldiers. Thanks buddy  but I could have figured that one out for myself.  Even worse  this movie is saturated with over-dramatic ploys. The most ridiculous scene involves a pair of boots. Picture this. A soldier walks along and finds a pair of worn out boots. One would think that such a find is utterly useless  but it turns out that the soldier's boots are in even worse condition  so he picks up the worn boots and leaves his SUPER worn boots behind. Fine  I get the point. The soldiers are in rough shape  a fact that is already clearly emphasized with their worn boots to begin with. The scene is ridiculous  but I was ready to let it go  until the SECOND soldier arrives! You see  he finds the previous soldier's SUPER worn boots and notices  get ready  cause here it comes  that his boots are SUPER DUPER worn boots! Lucky man  he picks up the SUPER worn boots and leaves his SUPER DUPER worn boots behind. But you see  that's not all  because the THIRD soldier then arrives! He finds the previous soldiers SUPER DUPER worn boots and inspects them  along with his own SUPER DUPER worn boots. Since both pairs suck  he tosses them both aside and smiles as he continues barefoot. At this point I was ready to throw my television through my living room window. The heavy handedness  overdramaticism  and paramount absurdity of this sequence is beyond bad film-making. It's SUPER DUPER bad film-making.  There are a number of similar  completely stupid moments to be had. Like the time when the lead character asks someone  Hey  are you dead? Like the guy is going to answer Yes if he actually kicked the bucket. I'll also be the first to condemn the subpar performance of the lead actor  who is the quintessential posterchild for artificial reaction. I laughed hard during that opening head slap where his head slingshot back in place with this stupid  goofy expression on his face.  The fact that this trivial fluff piece gets an IMDb average rating of 8.4 while a certifiable masterpiece like A Tale of Two Sisters (2003) only gets a 7.5 is the height of mass stupidity. And to think that some people actually delude themselves into thinking that AToTS doesn't make sense. Well  not every movie can have completely outrageous SUPER DUPER worn boots on its side.\n",

      "Although allegedly autobiographical  this movie demonstrates very little insight both into the protagonist's psychology (resulting in a flat  fragmented characterization) as well as into larger-scale historical processes  and my hope of either learning something new or improving my understanding of contemporary Iran remained unfulfilled. Instead  I found my sensibilities somewhat dulled as a succession of bearded Islamic villains replaced each other taunting  torturing or killing the wantonly victimized prototypical middle-class Iranian whose Western cultural sympathies were patent (and whose exoneration the movie quite blatantly seeks.) The deeper understanding the movie does seem to demonstrate is that of the mass-media market  as it serves to nourish prevalent occidental folk-ideologies (i.e. a crowd pleaser).   What redeemed the movie from being outright boring was its creative animation - genuinely minimalistic imagery which  nevertheless  always kept the screen rich  expressive and unambiguous - no small fete for which I do give it some stars.\n",

      "Now  I like the Bollywood films and I'm very glad they have recently gained success in the UK. However  Suneel Darshan's latest effort is a deeply flawed film from start to finish.  The idea of a modern-Bollywood take on Amadeus was quite an exciting one  that is until the two supposed 'musicians' appear on the scene looking as if they have never touched a piece of manuscript in their lives. Upen Patel is a very good looking man  and the film plays to his narcissistic sensibilities  but he is never once believable as a modern Mozart. In terms of acting  all he can do is stand there and pout. His expressions  hair and clothes all look the same throughout  including the scene where he is supposedly 'dying'  when in fact he appears to have nothing but a slight sniffle. Bobby Deol  playing the Salieri role  does his best to liven up what little wooden script there is but  alas  just comes across as a little bit angry when he is supposed to be fuming with jealousy.  Bollywood films are widely renowned for their stunning set-pieces and colour schemes  but Shaklaka looks like a drab BBC drama reproduction. In fact  the closest thing Shakalaka comes to is Hollyoaks  as it blatantly hides a really bad script behind beautiful people looking  well  beautiful. He has yet to reach mediocrity - the same could be said for the totally forgetful songs.  In short  Darshan's latest offering has no boom  bang  wallop or twang. Instead it merely plods along with its head held low hoping to catch your attention with a soft tap on the shoulder. And that is not good enough at all.\n",

It was a waste of time to watch it. When people started peeing all over the living room  it was too much to watch. Painful  awful crap movie. If they had just toned it down a little. Are there really people out there that find it funny and like it? I was relieved to know that IMDb readers rated it so low. The career side to the story was intriguing as well as the young man trying to get a promotion and win the bosses favor. I liked that part. Also  the opening scene with the coworkers on the train was cool as I like his coworker's characters.

      "Hubie -- like Stanely the troll from Bluth's A Troll in Central Park -- lacks the spark of personality to be the main character that carries an entire movie. We're supposed to like him because he's nice  but that's about all he is.  His character design is unappealing. The top of his head is a sort of dome that is narrower than the pudgy bottom half of his head.  And penguins should not have teeth. I know that Iago the parrot in Aladdin had teeth  but maybe that worked because it made him look more like his voice actor  Gilbert Gottfried. Hubie  with his weenie little voice (provided by Martin Short)  looks funny with that big set of chompers in his beak.  Tim Curry  who is usually delightful at being evil  does some sort of dippy surfer dude accent as the villain (might have been a good voice for a comic relief accomplice  not the supposedly menacing main villain).  The entire plot revolves around the hero and villain's love for female penguin Marina  who is just as dull as both of her suitors.  Worst of all is the pacing. We keep cutting back to the villain to watch him threaten Marina some more - this time in dialogue  this time in song...  Barry Manilow may be a great songwriter  but in animated films like this and Thumbelina  his songs feel limp and listless - especially the ballads. The only song I liked was the 1930's-ish Good Ship Misery song.  I read that the distributor made some cuts in this film against the filmmaker's wishes  and that could have caused some of the problems - though I suspect the real problem is that they didn't cut the rest of it ;).\n",

      "The 1977 animated-live action hybrid version of Gulliver's Travels (or rather 'Travel ' since he only gets as far as Lilliput) didn't get much of a release  and it's not too difficult to see why. Michel Legrand comes up with some catchy tunes  but they merely inspire lyricist Don Black to the likes of One simple fact remains/No-one here suffers from growing pains.' Richard Harris once again over-indulges in his passion for excessive makeup  toning down the eyeliner for far too much foundation this time in an effort to hide the fact he's at least 25 years too old for the role  but at least he (perhaps inappropriately) reduces his larger-than-life tendencies for a performance made up mainly of patronising whispering. The Belgian animation looks only slightly better than early morning French children's TV  but Peter Hunt's film is not nearly as bad as it sounds  the use of real model sets for the animated characters harks back to Max and Dave Fleischer's 1939 version while a couple of moments of Swiftian satire do remain - although it's definitely aimed at the youngest of children.\n",

      "Boy  this movie is bad. And not in a good  cheesy  fun way  either. Even MST3K couldn't stop it from being boring  and it's also confusing as all get out. But the most annoying part of this dull mess is Ireland's hideous high pitched voice  which I was tired of listening to in the first five minutes. Not to mention how really unappealing her character is. Even her Dad ran away and abandoned her! I can see why  frankly. If he'd had to listen to her whine in her little mouse voice for more than a few minutes  he'd have been tempted to do her a great harm. As I was  by the end of the movie. Plus  she's useless and annoying. When she falls down the long hole in the earth a la Alice in Wonderland  she'd have been done for in the first ten minutes if that inexplicably Australian accented miner hadn't kept saving her from all of the various plights she kept falling into. He should have just tied her to the Atlantean version of train tracks and been done with it. And this Atlantis underground with the weird  confusing obsession with bone density I have to ask-where was the light coming from down there? Did they have generators that imitate the sun? No matter. There's no real plot anyway  just a bunch of oddly costumed Goth wannabees running around trying to catch Kathy(probably so that they can stick a gag in her mouth). Stupid  pointless film.

      "I am a huge Randolph Scott fan  so I was surprised and disappointed to find he is barely in this film! The movie really belongs to Robert Ryan  who is the hero in the jam  and the one embroiled in the love triangle. Good grief  Gabby Hayes gets more screen time than Mr. Scott in this movie!! For many viewers  that is not a problem  but I am from the Walter Brennan school of sidekicks  not Gabby Hayes...although I will say that his lines were a bit more humorous than annoying in this film than in many of his films with Randolph Scott and John Wayne.  Personally  I found the movie very slow going  with a convoluted plot that was muddied even more by the unnecessary romance subplot. By convoluted  I don't mean impossible to understand or figure out  I just mean too messy for its own good.  The direction is uninspired  and the two main bad guys have the most unsatisfying come-uppance at the end. The whole movie comes across as fake  unrealistic  and poorly filmed.  Just so you don't think I can't find anything good here...  On the plus side  Anne Jeffreys is very sexy in her all-too-brief parts of this film. Not sure if it is actually her singing  or someone else  but whoever it was had a very pretty voice. Ms. Jeffreys also had a couple of nice acting moments. The script needed either a lot more of her  or to remove her character altogether. As it was  her nice few moments weren't enough to help the film.  Lastly  there is Mr. Scott. He looks fantastic in this film and is the no-nonsense lawman out to set things right. Some folks complain that his characters prior to 1950 were too goody-goody perfect  but that's never bothered me at all. I'll take him goody-goody pre-1950  or gritty and violent post-1950...either way  Randolph Scott was a real Western hero.  It saddens me to have to say it  but I would have to recommend passing this film by  unless you are a die-hard fan...there are so many better Scott films out there that this one won't be missed.\n",

      "This picture hit the movie screens on June 6th 1980  starring Stephen Macht as Sergeant Thor  Avery Schreiber as Captain Comelius Butt  J.D. Hinton as Buzz and starring Playmate of the year Dorothy Stratton. The picture starts with the police infinity roaming space looking for I guess criminals. There ship is suddenly attacked by an unknown space ship. Enters Sergeant Thor and his partner Buzz as they try to figure out who the unknown ship belongs to. When failing they call on Captain Comelius who instructs his crew to fight back. Enters the gorgeous Dorothy Stratton  who plays the role of Galaxina who is man made robot. An now a few thoughts on this picture. This movie was plan stupid and it's one of the reasons that I don't get into Sci-Fi. If you're into Sci-Fi you would have notice that the laser sound effects were borrowed from an early Sci-fi movie titled Battlestar Galactica which aired in theaters in 1978. Many of the door sounds that you hear in this movie came from another Sci-Fi movie that aired back in 1966 titled Star Trek. Now for the reason that I bought this movie  Dorothy Stratton. She is gorgeous in her one piece suit. I think her talents were wasted in this picture and she should have never been involved in such garbage. Connie Sellecca was also considered for the role and her talents would have been wasted also. On the picture alone I give this movie 1 weasel star and on Dorothy Stratton I give her 10 weasel stars even though she didn't deserve to be put into a trash movie like this. If you like pictures like this you can get the DVD version on Amazon.com\n",

      "The French either make pro-Marxist films or anti-Marxist films - with a few in between. Merci pour le chocolat is the latter of this genre. From the opening credits telling the viewer what music is going to be played and by whom it was who composed you know that you are going to be swathed in middle class pretension. It is an old man's film with an excess of 40's plus people. It is also directed by an old man along with an old crew who have nothing to say about life to the viewer. The plot is not only banal but preposterous. How many films reveal the plot through dialogue only to repeat the same message via flashback some five minutes later? Maybe the director and actors had a low retentive capacity? In truth their is no tenable plot at all. It is riddle with holes like a good piece of French cheese.  Whether intentional or not  it is a film about the bourgeoisie. At least a third of the film focuses on the piano and the pretentious twaddle espoused in each scene. I concede it has some well framed shots though they couldn't have used a steady-cam in this film - it would have woke them all up! Other than it being a nonsense story  the film allows the upper middle class to parade their values and vanity in a very comfortable Swiss location. A telling line of the film is when Rodolphe Pauly tells Anna Mouglalis that she need not lock her car while in the resort! Oh dear me.  On the DVD  Miss Huppert makes a comment about shedding a false tear for a scene. Smirking she says: Like they do in the American Actor's Studio! I think Miss Huppert and the rest of the cast could learn well from the Actor's Studio.  If there is one statement that stand out in my mind it is when Huppert remarks 'we are having friends for the weekend and all the servants are away'. No doubt they had all escaped from the mind numbing set lest they be associated with such an appalling film.  Safety Medical Note. In the film they show a hot water scald being covered with ointment and a bandage. This should never be done. Only cold water should be used.  Minus 10 marks.\n",

      "This is a good blueprint for a study of corporate power and the dichotomoy between required public life and the need for privacy. Robert Taylor has been primed by corporate head Burl Ives as a surrogate son to replace him as head of the corporation. He sends him to England to negotiate a deal  where Taylor is both taken aback by the ethics and morality of the men he is dealing with and manages to fall in love with a refugee while he's at it. He comes back emtpy handed  having done his duty but having told the truth to the English about his motives. He attempts to marry the refugee rather than the boss's niece and so begins an attempt by Ives to discredit the refugee as a suitable wife for a corporate executive. It could have been gritter  nastier and less romantic - the amount of time spent on the romance skews the film away from the points it's trying to make about corporate ethics.  Somehow the costume design was nominated (undeservedly) for an Oscar - it's all business suits and the two women in the film dress conservatively - studio politics at work yet again  no doubt.  What is stiking however is the black and white CinemaScope cinematography which is excellent - this if anything deserved the Oscar nom. (It was MGM's first 'Scope film in B&W).

      "'The Mill on the Floss' was one of the lesser novels by Mary Ann Evans  who wrote under the male pseudonym George Eliot. I tried to read this dull and very turgid novel years ago  but was unable to finish it. I'll review this film version solely on its own merits  as I don't know how faithfully it follows the original novel.  The film's opening credits are printed in an Old English typeface that suggests the mediaeval period  and so it's a very poor choice for a film with a 19th-century setting. (On the other hand  about halfway into the film  we see a close-up shot of a handbill advertising an estate auction. This handbill is set in authentic Victorian type fonts  and looks *very* convincing.) Most of this film is extremely convincing in its depiction of the architecture and clothing of early 19th-century England. The precise location of this film's story is never disclosed  but - judging by the actors' accents - I'd place it as somewhere in the Cotswolds  perhaps Warwickshire.  The plot  what there is of it  involves a mill that changes hands a couple of times (over a couple of decades) between two rival families  one wealthy and one working-class. I disagree with another IMDb reviewer who claims that James Mason has only a small role in this film. Mason has the largest and most central role in this drama  as the scion of the wealthier family. As the spoilt and petulant Tom Tulliver  Mason is darkly brooding and impetuous. His performance here belongs in a better film: it made me want to see 'Wuthering Heights' recast with Mason as Heathcliff.  As this is a multi-generational saga (something which George Eliot did much better in 'Middlemarch')  several of the main roles in this film are split among two actors apiece: child actors in the prologue  adults in the main narrative. The prologue of this film features a very well-written scene  establishing Tom Tulliver as wilful and bully-ragging from an early age  and young Philip Wakeham as decent and thoughtful. Through hard labour  Philip has earned a halfpenny: Tom tries to bully it away from him  but is unwilling to take the coin by brute force: he wants Philip to *give* it to him. All the child actors in this movie  male and female  are talented and attractive. Unfortunately  all of the children speak their dialogue in posh plummy-voiced accents that are utterly unlike the accents of the actors and actresses who play those same roles as adults. This discrepancy calls attention to the staginess of the material. Regrettably  none of the later scenes are as good as this prologue.  The climax features a crowd of labourers in a rainstorm  much better paced and photographed than the earlier scenes. But modern viewers (in Britain  at least) can no longer take this sort of material seriously. By now  practically every British comedian has done a trouble at t' mill  squire comedy routine  parodying precisely this subject matter  so I had difficulty watching this movie with a straight face.  The character actress Martita Hunt is good in a small role  but the opening credits (in that Old English typeface) misspell her forename as 'Marita'. I'll rate this dull movie 3 points out of 10: one point apiece for James Mason's performance  the early scene with the children  and the authentic Victorian typesetting in that auctioneer's handbill.\n",

The major problems why everyone is complaining about the twists in the film is that the film is just not fascinating enough to make people follow them. The film is badly shot (at least in comparison to its genre brother Lock  Stock). Worse: the characters are (although often well acted) just plain flat. The characters don't have enough time to be introduced well enough to let the viewer get involved with a single one of them  let alone understand them.

      "There are no saving graces in this dreadful  stagey  boring snooze-fest  which brings to mind The Ransom Of Red Chief!   Even though there are some big stars in this film  the acting is almost uniformly terrible.   Glenn Ford  normally a laid-back kind of guy  hams it up with forced emotion.   Donna Reed is so over-the-top as to prove laughable.   Leslie Nielson is woefully miscast and is terrible.   The son is such a repulsive little brat  I found myself rooting for the kidnappers.   The only decent performance in this mish-mash is the relatively minor role of the butler.   Perhaps I'm being too harsh on the actors  after all  all they did were to read the lines given them in the script. Ah  the script  that turgid piece of contrived dreck that would like to tug on your heart strings but merely turns your stomach.\n",

      "There was a time when the Alien series was a success with even the third installment  Alien 3  showing promise under the guild of a fresh and young David Fincher. The first Predator was a box office hit mainly due to its story  in peak star Arnold Schwarzenegger and director John McTiernan (Die Hard). The films Alien  Aliens  Alien 3 and Predator were all highly successful and created massive followings among general film fans and science fiction fans alike. Arguably Predator 2 and Alien Resurrection should have signaled the end for both franchises  but studios were undeterred and saw the opportunity to pander to the rumours among fans and combine the two. Step in Paul W.S Anderson  Alien Vs Predator  and now the Brothers Strauss (visual effects graduates  not even directors or writers). The problem was that by allowing such profound and revolutionary creations of the Sci-Fi genre to fall into the hands of firstly a mediocre director and now directorial newbie's has led to nothing more than profanity  epitomised by incompetence. Upon witnessing Alien Vs Predator Requiem (AVPR) die-hard fans will feel sick to their stomachs that this series could have got any worse.  One example of the cinematic deterioration of this franchise is in the opening scene and is likely to cause nausea among fans. The film begins with an Alien making its way onto the Predator ship  spurting from the predators chest  growing in to a full grown Predalien and bringing down the Predator craft (which now seems to have far less Predators on it than it did at the end of Alien Vs Predator) and all this occurs with the ship still in Earths atmosphere. Once the ship has crashed AVPR quickly resorts to cheap plot methods and basic narrative conventions  it makes no venture at utilizing any of the twists or subversions served up in the two original films. The wearisome plot progresses with tedious pace  punctuated only by the near rousing conflicts of Alien and Predator and when that runs the risk of boring us we are treated to either an alluring blonde in a bikini or rapid gunfire. AVPR is plagued by an endless array of continuity errors and plot holes with little or no narrative elucidation i.e. members of the public outwitting an elite military unit or the Predator not adhering to laws established in previous editions. This is a film that has a complete disregard for its predecessors  it breaks some of the most fundamental rules of a sequel and in doing so one gets the feeling that it is trying to set itself up as a stand alone feature. Independently the film has no heart  no conviction and no soul and with reference to the other films lacks even the most basic continuity. This is exemplified by the over arching narrative of the film as it undermines the basic premise of the first Alien. Because if the species had been encountered before then those in the first Alien film would have been more proficient and not so ill prepared when encountering them.  On a cinematic note the film is close to being dire  I felt urged at some points to shine a torch at the screen  the lighting was so bad. Through utilizing such gloomy and dark effects the audience may feel as though they are being cheated out of some the action  which is ironically its purpose and also indicates the films lack of budget. As with all science fiction one scene normally surfaces as being the most memorable  in this instance it is probably the hospital impregnation scene as it ever so tenuously draws on the themes of the original Alien by literalizing it. The directing is poor  performances weak and the script rotten. AVPR is the product of a conveyor belt system of film-making in which ideas and techniques are assembled by ineffective people and then the finished product distributed among cinemas. This is personified by the absence of gory death scenes and drawn out blood battles because the certification will not allow it  a lower certification achieving a larger target audience. AVPR was purely a business venture and nothing more.\n",

      "To be honest  I did never read one of the comics and cannot remember part 2 and 3 at all. I can compare to the first part (Werner - Beinhart) and this one here is really disappointing  compared to part1 as well as compared to most other movies I watched the last weeks. The first minutes seam to be just a needless clone of the first movie intro and then it is becoming even worse. There are a few good (funny) scenes  but in total it is just another boring second-rate try of German film industry that cannot succeed (nearly as usual). One good thing: The movie is quite short (75 min.) The bad thing: It only contains story and jokes for 45 Minutes ;) -> Don't watch it\n",

      "This film was strongly recommended by a friend and  being a great fan of Brando  I ordered this film from Harrods and eagerly waited for it to arrive. I have seldom been so disappointed by a film. Brando was good as a German officer but the rest of the film was simply unbearable. You never get to like or care for any of the characters (except Brando  maybe). The acting was OK. Story  what story? Maybe that's the point. It's war after all  but I've seen far better war films. (Lawrence of Arabia  Apocalypse Now  even Star Wars) It was so boring I kept checking my watch...  Overall this is one of the worst films I have seen. Please don't waste your time and money on this. May I also add that this is the first user comment I have written  I just had to let my feelings about this film known.  By the way  my all time favourites are: Casablanca  The Godfather 1 &2  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest  Pulp Fiction and Amadeus. If you haven't seen them yet  please spare the time to do so.

Are there any rules to Quintet? Were Robert Altman and his cohorts making the movie up as they went along? What was Paul Newman thinking when he signed on to this? Maybe ol' Fast Eddie saw Zardoz and thought Well if Connery can get involved in a futuristic film that makes no sense  so can I. Maybe the good stuff is on the cutting room floor and all we get to see is the incoherent stuff. Also  did all the cast get to keep their individual funny hats?

      "One day I thought to myself....what is the worst possible thing that could happen today? I answered my self with a simple  Oh  it already happened. I rented Killjoy/Killjoy 2 on DVD. Well  what is there to say? The budget was not large enough to rent a police uniform  the movie cuts out sex scenes and death scenes. There is one funny line that I can remember  and the acting is far worse than the first one. There seems to be no lighting on the set (the woods somewhere) and the killer clown known as Killjoy (who makes Leprechaun look like The Exorcist)is less than spectacular. This time  he is not portrayed by Angel Vargas and is completely changed as a character from a crazy irritating clown to a different kind of crazy irritating clown that says CHILD a lot. Somewhere between Freddy Krueger and a blade of grass... lies this version of Killjoy. Somewhere between a pile of dirt and a pile of s---t lies Killjoy 2. It's badness is underrated. This movie does not have any redeeming qualities  except the song at the very end over the credits... which at leas provides some enjoyment. Killjoy 2 is not even really a movie  so much as an exercise in tension. Killjoy 1 is at least good enough to be considered as the worst movie I have ever seen. MINOR SPOILER######### Let me describe one of the supernatural kill scenes. A girl is locked in a wood shed of some sort (maybe an outhouse?) when Killjoy peers in through a hole. He has some small chattering teeth (like the ones you can buy at Spencer's Gifts) and he does something with them (maybe winds them up?!). Then he holds them in his hands and says a terrible line (which can't be written on IMDB). From what I gather of this scene (not from what is shown by the movie) the teeth went into the outhouse and killed the girl in some interesting  but unshown way  and then came back to Killjoy. If I were those teeth I would have run. Run far from Killjoy so he could never ever get his hands on me again. Killjoy 2 is hopefully the last Killjoy we will have to endure. Even as a fan of movies others would say are very bad  I think that this film could unify the human race and create world peace if it were promised that this film and anything reminding us of it would be destroyed. I give it 2/10 - simply because the creators succeeded at making the pictures move.\n",

I heard  I do not know if this is true  but companies make these films in foreign countries for tax purposes. I believe this because why else would they make this film  it sure wasn't to make money. We had a whole lot of these Canadian made stinkers  because the government gave tax breaks to create a movie industry. I wonder if it payed off in the other countries like in Canada. Anyway  back to topic this film is poorly made in every aspect  I believe they grabbed Charles Bronson in order to sell this stinker; that dead body at the end looks very phony. 3/10\n",

      "The scariest thing about freshman director Carter Smith's new horror movie The Ruins is the closing credits that list comedian Ben Stiller as one of the executive producers. What was Stiller thinking when he sank his bucks into this chiller about cursed carnivorous undergrowth that creeps up on its victims and devours them. Oscar-nominated scenarist Scott B. Smith of A Simple Plan  adapting his own bestselling novel  sticks steadfastly to the standard clichés and conventions of all twentysomething scary sagas where reckless youth do everything but tote signs begging the forces of evil to eat them. Were cretinous characters not enough to contend with in this nihilistic nonsense  we're treated to yet another film where American tourists find themselves in jeopardy simply because they are Americans. Furthermore  unlike really good horror movies that explain why the monsters have a need to feed  The Ruins provides no explanation for the supernatural shenanigans of its villainous vines.   The set-up for The Ruins resembles the 2006 horror movie Turistas where slimy South Americans trapped brainless American backpackers and harvested them for their internal organs. Indeed  Turistas generated some legitimate thrills and chills. The Ruins spawns nothing in the way of either thrills or chills. A malicious mastiff that suddenly lurches on-camera to snarl at our heroes is as close as it gets to a thrill.   The rest of The Ruins borrows from another movie: The Descent  a superb  2006 chiller about a bunch of babes plunged into a nightmare experience when they get lost in warren of caves inhabited by albino mutants with a blood lust for murder. A couple of other movies that served either intentionally or unintentionally come to mind  too. They are the straightforward 1968 Hammer horror classic The Lost Continent about murderous vegetation that menaces innocent bystanders in a sea of derelict ships and the Roger Corman cult class The Little Shop of Horrors (1961)about a New York florist that grows a man-eating plant in his shop..   The Ruins unfolds in the scenic  sunny Mexico where four frolicking American college kids  Eric (Shawn Ashmore of the X-Men movies)  Stacy (Laura Ramsey of The Covenant)  Jeff (Jonathan Tucker of Sleepers) and Amy (Jena Malone of Pride & Prejudice)  are wrapping up their tequila-soaked spring break. Stacy loses a prized earring in a motel swimming pool  but a helpful Teutonic  twentysomething tourist  Mathias (Joe Anderson of Copying Beethoven) recovers it  and the group embraces him as newest best friend. These people live to party  and they have already made friends with a trio of Greek tourists. Mathias tells them about his wayward brother who has accompanied a cute female archaeologist to a remote Mayan pyramid that isn't listed in any guidebooks. He offers to take them with him and they accept.   First rule of horror movies: if nobody knows about the place where you're going  you'd be well advised to avoid it. Since they have only one day left  and they haven't done anything adventurous  our two couples along with their Spanish-speaking Greek friend  Dimtri (newcomer Dimitri Baveas)  decide to follow Mathias and check the pyramid out. They catch a bus into the interior of Mexico and look for a taxi to take them on the next leg of their journey. A cabbie glances at their map and warns them to stay away. Second rule of horror movies: when the natives warn you to steer clear  you steer clear. A crisp twenty dollar bill helps him change his mind  and he hauls them off to their destination and then he skedaddles in a heartbeat.   No sooner have our heroes found the mysterious Mayan pyramid covered with undergrowth that looks suspiciously like a variation of Mississippi kudzu in the jungle than superstitious natives appear. They know that the pyramid is haunted  and they kill Dimtri without a qualm when he tries to dispel their fears. The remaining protagonists scramble to safety atop the pyramid while the paranoid natives surround them to prevent them from escaping. Eventually  the vines slink out to greet our heroes and eat them. At this point  The Ruins turns into Bug  the recent and ridiculous Ashley Judd schizoid movie about insects that get under your skin. Before long our heroes are carving each other up in a futile effort to extract the vines from under their skin. One particularly gruesome scene shows the Americans lopping off the German guy's legs to save his life. By comparison  it makes the tortures of the Spanish Inquisition look tame.   The Ruins ranks as just another vine mess with nothing to redeem it.\n",

      "First off  I'am a horror fan. But this Tobe Hooper production (come on  the man from the original Texas Chainsaw and Poltergeist !!) was below standards  even for a fan. The acting was not bad at all  some characters were unbelievable  but the leading ladies were OK. The story was something we've seen a hundred times already  without any surprising twist or whatever. Never exciting or intense  and do not count on any special effects besides blood splashing up. The scary zombie kids are white paled faces with dark eyes and that is it.. That might have worked in the early 70's but not now. Director J.S. Cardone didn't do a good job in keeping the suspense  half way thru there is a risk you will fall asleep. My vote is based primarily on the leading acting  but this could have easily have been called Children Of The Corn 8: From The Corn Fields to the Mines... Enough said..\n",

      "Dolemite is the touching story of Dolemite (Gotta love blaxploitation film titles)  an ex-con who probably should still be in jail. He gets in trouble with cops  friends  drug dealers  women  prostitutes  and society in general. He's just not that likable a guy. Neither is the movie  though it's still hilarious and worth watching.  The flimsy premise is that Dolemite (played with as much enthusiasm as star Rudy Ray Moore can muster) is in jail for a crime he claims he didn't commit. When a drug hit or a drug bust or drug something is about to go down  the warden releases him to stop it  or help it  or just watch it. Not very clear. All I know is that I was unaware that the justice system frees convicts in order to allow them to prove their own innocence. My ignorance  I guess.  The plot is convoluted and unimportant  basically Dolemite goes around killing people (Usually with very poorly choreographed karate)  having sex  and cursing out people  sometimes even rhyming too. The joys of the movie are its total incompetence  and its total indifference in the matter.  I stopped counting the number of times I saw the boom mike after it was in one scene for the entire duration (about two minutes of film). I stopped questioning why the warden was looking down at where Dolemite was sitting  even after he stood up and walked around  when they cut back to the establishing shot and Dolemite was inexplicably sitting down again. I stopped wondering why Dolemite dressed like that when he got naked on the street to change  because he didn't want to get in his car with the ugly (read: normal) clothes the jail gave him. And I stopped wondering where he learned karate when he jiggles his hand on a guy's stomach and somehow cuts him open. The only time I was ever remotely nervous and tense was when the disgusting  flabby white mayor is walking around totally naked with nothing but a towel hanging around his neck which just barely covers him up. You keep saying Cut away...cut away...cut away but by the time they do  you are already emotionally scarred.  The movie is ridiculous in every way imaginable. Moore as Dolemite  is either funny  cool  or both. If you're on the lookout for a bad movie  you have found it with Dolemite.\n",

      "Like a lot of films from the early sounds days  Cimarron must be viewed more for historical interest than as compelling entertainment. The hammy acting of lead Richard Dix  nominated for best actor  can be excused as a relic of the silent-film school of acting. However  even giving benefits of the doubt  Cimarron is a badly shaped piece of drama -- a bloated film that moves from unrelated sequence to unrelated sequence with little dramatic impact. Offically  the film is two hours and four minutes; it feels like four hours when you're watching it. There is no reason to waste your time on it unless you want to see every Best Picture winner or have a keen interest in the early sound days. In my opinion  Cimarron is the worst choice for best picture in Academy history and the award should have gone to City Lights or Little Ceasar. Cimarron is barely remembered today  and would have be remembered at all if not for its Oscar win.\n",

And  just as with Planet...  its lead actor is woefully miscast and leaden; Guy Pearce  a terrific actor of great range  is all wrong for this role  giving a one-note performance that elicits zero sympathy; he's so dour and serious  and lacking in awe of the (supposedly) amazing things he sees that you don't believe for a moment that he's experiencing them. Worse yet  whose idea was it for him to resemble the love child of David Spade and Calista Flockhart?? A handsome actor  here he is sickeningly gaunt  which is  believe it or not  a major distraction. Frankly  the man looks gravely ill and is photographed cruelly. He shares absolutely NO chemistry with anyone on the screen  a direct result of a performance that is out of sync with anyone else's. Sadly  even with a proper leading man this movie doesn't stand a chance for it is fatally burdened with both a totally inept director - whole scenes go nowhere and are poorly realized - and a screenplay that is utterly inferior  scattered and at times incoherent - not for a single moment do you care about anyone in this film  for the single fact that there is NOTHING in the way of character development! In the original  you got to KNOW the Eloi  so therefore you felt for them  and felt their terror of the Morelocks; here  as the movie stresses several times  they are nothing but sheep and act accordingly. Unless you're a member of PETA  scared sheep are HARDLY the stuff of entertainment!   Samantha Mumba does as well as possible  in her movie debut  but  like everyone else in this mess  most especially Jeremy Irons (if he's the leader of the Morelocks [who look like rejects from The Mummy Returns]  why then does HE look like Edgar Winter's long-lost brother?) is COMPLETELY WASTED. Also wasted was the money spent on the endless 'special' effects  which belie the $70M spent on the film; they are uniformly lackluster  obvious and unconvincing. And then there's the look of the film: poorly photographed  its art direction and sets are just there and its costumes are typical in design. There isn't an original thought or idea expressed behind or on the screen. Most of all  it isn't even fun! (The filmmakers use the now-ubiquitous Orlando Jones as comic relief but  as usual  Jones is irritating  and just HOW does his electrically-driven character survive in a world seemingly devoid of electricity?)  All in all  this is an empty  lifeless  dull  sterile and confused affair: didn't they ALREADY REMAKE Planet of the Apes??? (At least THAT had the fortune of some strong performances!)   *SPOILER!* The final insult (beyond a head-shakingly terrible  not to mention convenient  ending)?

Mat i Syn makes Stalker look like Raiders of the Lost Ark. By no means should you miss this film! There's no excuse - even if you live a busy life  you can still enjoy this film to its fullest by holding down the fast-forward button on your VCR. Sokurov has given us the first feature length film that can be appreciated in 12 minutes.  I suppose the next great masterpiece of the form will come when someone has the vision and courage to exhibit a film that consists of no sound or image at all - 45 minutes of a black  silent screen (wasn't this already explored in In The Soup?).  Apparently the filmmaker (and fans) have forgotten that motion is the first word of motion picture.  !!!MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!!  Want to reach the heights of genius that this film achieved? Here's a step by step guide:  1. Find a talented photographer.  2. Find some subjects and a suitably picturesque landscape (think Tuscany!). If you need inspiration  watch some luxury car or perfume commercials.  3. Shoot about 3 rolls of film.  4. Photoshop the results to play around with saturation  blur & aspect ratio.  5. Now just get out your movie camera  film 40 of the best pictures and have your actors mumble their lines off-screen. Don't worry about writing it ahead of time - just let the actors say whatever they want (lines like Do you want a drink? and Let's get something to eat are really all you need to fill up 8 minutes or so). If you can't think of enough dialog - no problem! Just have them repeat what they say a few times. If that still isn't enough  just let the camera run anyway.  Congratulations  another masterpiece! As a bonus  if you want to distribute it over the internet  no problem! The static images will compress down to nothing with standard mpeg encoding - a 73 minute movie would probably be about 2-3 megabytes  even at the highest quality levels.\n",

This comedy was a very cruel joke at the expense of the actors  the theatre-going public and of all the nice films that have contributed to their reputations.  I repeat: is the joke about trashing the actors' other highly respectable on-screen personae with this scurrilously trashy flick? Can the reference to the Austen classics 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Sense and Sensibility' be anything else? How much of a political statement was it to produce this melodrama using these stars?

Jack Warden is good  because as usual  he plays Jack Warden.  Like 90% of the films rated on IMDb (whether they are classics  mediocre or crapola) somehow this one gets rated with 7-point-some-stars. It is in no way deserving of that. Save your time\n",

      "It'll be a blue Christmas indeed if you subject you're family to this. I loved the original movie  and this one was not worthy of being its sequel. Actually  for all intents and purposes  it is not its sequel. Only one character from the original cast returns. Granted  that character happened to be the hilarious cousin Eddie  but he simply is not hilarious being the protagonist of a movie. His niche is that of the wacky relative who performs zany antics--alongside Chevy Chase. Chevy Chase was needed in this film for it to be a success  and he definitely was not there. As far as I am concerned  a movie is not a Vacation movie unless good ole' Clark Griswold is at the helm.\n",

      "This is a great movie for first time ninjas who are dating. If you're trying to impress some cute little ninjette I would highly recommend playing this masterpiece. Its one of those special movies that allows you to miss large sections of it without interfering with the plot.  Also I was wondering  where does a Teal ninja hide? Are ninjas color coded like this? Is this normal? If I were attacked by one of these yellow or orange ninjas I would die of laughter before succumbing to his sword.  And I finished my black star ninja test the other day  it was multiple choice  It went pretty good. I found there were a lot of questions on how to sneak around and look evil. Its all about the eyebrows and the attitude.   Basically  the movie could have been better if: 1. There was no color coded ninjas (or the color coded ninjas could combine into a super ninja). 2. Joe died in the first two minutes and Patricia had to avenge him 3. Miscellaneous monkeys were scattered throughout the file 4. Patricia didn't talk and Patricia was replaced with another character 6. The French guy was also a black star ninja 7. Chris Tucker  Whoopi Golderg  and Chris Rock were added as comic relief 8. Ninja strengths came from miticlorians.\n",

      "The recent DVD release of Good Humor Man labels the film as comedy. It's hardly a comedy  rather a dull indie film about a group of losers. Supposedly set in the 70s  there is scant attention paid to period details  with overly muted color correction taking its place. The monotonous soundtrack only serves to accentuate the repetitiveness of the film (perhaps that is the point  but it does not add to the enjoyment of the viewing experience.) Apprarently the clique of losers only like to hang out at one location  the bleachers. It seems like the packaging of the film as a comedy is meant to deceive people into renting or buying this film  which is a complete waste of time.\n",

Does it comes as any surprise that a coming out film stars an unusually attractive (and blond to boot) boy with 70s shag hair and too-cool-for-school clothes? Plus  this film wallows in late 1970s chic  which works for some (Sofia Coppola's The Virgin Suicides comes to mind) but not for this director.  Another reviewer compared this to Harmony Korine's work and I agree. Yet I don't view this as a positive thing (what has HE done lately  anyway?). Bobbycrush is really just a waste of time and energy for all involved. If you happen to see it late night on cable  turn the channel and watch something else instead.\n",

      "Jess Franco makes exploitation films  and he has made tons of them. Franco is responsible for some of the most shocking films in cinema history  and god bless him for it. Unfortunately  The Diamonds of Kilominjaro is a truly awful movie that is not up to his usual standards.  Exploitation films should be judged on story  sex  and gore. What else is there? This film fails on most of those benchmarks. The plot is paper thin  placing a nubile young girl in the jungle among cannibals. We really don't get information on why she and her father were there in the first place. As expected  her father is the Big White Chief and she becomes a goddess  sitting in trees  naked. Add fortune hunters and precious stones  and you have your basic rescue the girl for greedy intentions plot line. The characters are stock  not adding an ounce of believability to the proceedings.  Gore? None  or at least very little. This film is often mentioned in the same vein as the classic Italian cannibal movies. Those seeking that type of gore need to run the other way. Save for one cheap be-heading  this movie features surprisingly little blood and guts.  As best I can tell the only reason this movie exists is so Katja Bienert  Aliene Mess  and Mari Carmen Neieto could run around naked. Actually Lita (Mari Carmen Neieto) does the full frontal heavy lifting  while the two jungle ladies are bare chested throughout. Yes  there are love scenes....probably the most sterile Franco has ever supervised. The women are beautiful  but nothing here to really make this movie an erotic classic either.  This movie just reeks of low budget buffoonery. The sets are laughable. The acting is horrid  and the editing is confusing. There is no real story to hold this together  and not enough of a budget (or effort) to shock or titillate. I think Franco fans have come to expect more out of the master of exploitation.\n",

      "This movie tries to rip off Predator  but that movie is much better. This movie has truly terrible special effects and a mindless plot. The team that enters the forest to find the cause of the disappearances of military and scientist is a combo of rough and rugged male delta commandos and pretty but tough female rangers. None of them are too bright. All the characters seem to be more than willing to run off into the forest alone and headfirst into a spear or sword and their death. Some of the pyrotechnics are very big and must have cost a bundle. But the close-ups of the creature are laughable as are most of the death scenes. Every cliché that the writers could think of was used. If you're looking for a mindless slaughter fest  this may fill the bill. The night I watched this was very slow so I sat through the whole thing. I have to admit that it's been a while since I watched something this bad. There is very little to redeem this movie.

      "Rutger Hauer helps along a film that basically can be summed up in the young person finding themselves category  and rather obviously so  so it needs a lot of help.  The beginning holds a lot more promise  of a film that could turn into Michael Clayton or Stranger Than Fiction. It's too bad because I really got hooked into the beginning. Then  like the opening soundtrack  it went from great and intriguing to basically nowhere.  It's fun enough with plenty of curiosities and interesting characters acted well. I'm sure that will be enough for many people. The problem is it all feels contrived and empty which  ironically  is supposed to be the main discovery for the character's self realization. Not the film itself (it's not a self aware film)  but that the character is supposed to recognize his own life is contrived and empty.\n",

      "When Jim Wynorski first announced he would be doing a new sequel for my favorite series of all time  the Slumber Party Massacre series  I was ecstatic. I had been waiting for a new installment for literally years. So  production began and very small bits and pieces on the shoot and the actors involved were released until the shoot wrapped. Then  the announcement of a title change. No longer would this new sequel be titled Slumber Party Massacre IV  but Cheerleader Massacre instead. I was a bit disappointed  but having a different title would be a very small price to pay for a film I had waited so long to happen. I was still extremely intrigued and on the edge of my seat to see it.  Maybe a month ago  some very advanced copies of the film were released to some extremely lucky viewers  who got to see the film months before its release date. A few reviews leaked on the net and judging by them  I began to become apprehensive on Jim Wynorski's Cheerleader Massacre.  Tonight  I got to see the film for the first time in full length and I am still scratching my head. As I read in another review  Cheerleader Massacre is definitely NOT a new installment in the Slumber Party Massacre series  but a slasher flick all on its own. And a bad one at that.  Before I get into the specifics of the film  let me first state what an enormous fan of Jim Wynorski's films I am. I always thought him to be a true camp genius  with a winner almost every time. Yes  his movies are made on shoestring budgets and don't contain the most top-notch acting around  but they're fun nonetheless. They are what they are: campy movies you watch when you want to have a good time. From Sorority House Massacre II  to Hard to Die  to Chopping Mall  Jim has produced the goods on more than one occasion. One of the reasons why I was excited that this film would be his latest project.  Cheerleader Massacre does not (in my opinion) reflect any of the films I had seen this director/writer create in the past. Firstly  the production was extremely inexpensive and the film was actually shot on videotape  something I had never seen Jim do before. The actors were mediocre  to say the least  and the story is almost laughable. The killer is also extremely stupid and reminds you more of your cuddly old grandpa  rather than an escaped lunatic.  Of course  the film is littered with female nudity. This is a Jim Wynorski movie we're talking about  folks. But some of the boob-shots seen here almost seem like they were done for time. There is an extremely long shower scene  containing the cheerleading coach  that seems to go on forever and it greatly reflects a shower scene in Jim's Sorority House Massacre II. The girl even bathes herself almost in the exact same way.  Cheerleader Massacre is also extremely cliched  to say the least. The opening scene is literally something we've all seen in HUNDREDS of past slasher flicks. A guy and a girl making out  on the verge of consummating their relationship when...you guessed it. They're hacked to pieces.  Brinke Stevens  who I've never really considered to be a tremendous actress in the first place  also gives one of her stiffest and forced performances in her small cameo. We're talkin' possible cue cards here. She recalls some incidents her character endured by the killer seen here twenty years ago to the police  while footage of the original Slumber Party Massacre plays. Why was footage from the original film used if it was definitely not a new SPM? I have no idea. There is also two explosions seen in this movie that I am almost certain were recycled from other films.  Not only does this film recycle FOOTAGE from past films  but it also recycles the scores from other films as well. Some of the music used in Humanoids from the Deep (which was also recycled prior for The Coroner) can be heard throughout the entire film. There are at least two more as well that I cannot identify  but am certain have been used before.  After sitting through this film's horrendous acting  ridiculous story  non-existent gore/special effects  and camcorder-like quality  I am having some serious concerns toward Mister Wynorski's career. Has the man who delighted audiences with films in the past finally lost his niche? Only time will tell. Oh  and let's not forget his newest film. A new installment in the Sorority House Massacre films  now titled Final Exam. I think I'm seeing a pattern here...\n",

I'll give it a few points because Gabin is in it  but the clumsy plot  cheap sets and the ludicrous Annabella making like an Arab princess put the film on my `to sell' shelf. If you watch it  you'll find yourself asking  why didn't the idiots build the fort *around* the well  instead of a deadly few yards away from it. And why use tin roofs in the middle of the desert? But by then the sheer perversity of contrivance that makes up the script should numb you to any further contemplation.\n",

      "I was so disappointed in this movie. I am very familiar with the case  having read not only Mark Fuhrman's book but also the far superior A Wealth of Evil: The True Story of the Murder of Martha Moxley in America's Richest Community by Timothy Dumas. Anyone who watches MURDER IN GREENWICH should be aware they're watching The Mark Fuhrman story  not the Martha Moxley story. This film is nothing more than an ego-trip for Fuhrman. Just watch his character strut around as if he is the second coming (yes  even being ogled by women). The actors playing the kids look way too old for their roles and the flashbacks to the 1970s are totally unconvincing. If there is any hero to this story  it's Martha's family  her mother Dorothy and brother John. They kept this case alive for two decades before Fuhrman walked into it in order to make a name for himself. They  and Martha  deserve to have the true story told.\n",

      "It must say something about the state of our nation that this programme is one of the most popular currently screened.   The 'square' is peopled by such a miserable  untrustworthy  amoral  spiteful  unrelentingly dour group of characters as can be imagined. Everyone is stabbing someone in the back  everyone is attempting to commit adultery  everyone is trying to cheat someone. That  or they are being stabbed  cuckolded or swindled. Nobody is cheerful. Nobody laughs. Nobody has a blinding stroke of luck or a really nice day. It's hell  with cockney accents.  I suspect this programme must be sponsored by The Samaritans. It's perfect viewing for the depressed. It doesn't cheer them up; what it does do is present a whole community of such terminally despondent sad-arses that viewers are moved to believe their lot really could be worse - they might be living in 'Albert Square'.  Apart from the above; as a representation of London's east end  it is pure hokum. The programme-makers have evidently never been across town. The first thing you encounter on the Mile End Road is a colossal mosque. And this pretty-well defines the racial majority of the population. White British Londoners are a dispersed and rapidly diminishing minority. A large advertisement hoarding presently near the Bow Road flyover  and sponsored by Tower Hamlets Health Care boasts that 'Eight out of ten members of the community can now see their doctor more quickly'. Ten healthy  smiling faces beam down at the observer in confirmation. Eight of them are dark-skinned...   What's more  I used to work with a bunch of Anglo-Saxon - dare I say 'pukka' - cockneys a few years ago. And I can tell you that a more obnoxiously racist experience I've never had. Each day was like an Oswald Moseley rally. They couldn't pass 5 minutes without denigrating some other race or nationality than their own  and in terms that were repulsive and obscene. 'Fackin' Pakis' and 'fackin' Maceroons' were the small change of conversation. In fact their entire (and extremely limited) stock of adjectives fixated upon sex-organs and their application. Alf Garnett was a paragon of liberal virtue in comparison.  Any programme that purported to represent London's native east-end Caucasians in their true nature would be completely unfit for broadcast - even after the 9 o-clock watershed. Imagine a Ku Klux Klan script written by Quentin Tarantino and you'd be somewhere near the mark. But when they weren't being inveterate bigots they were at least extremely cheerful.  I don't know how such a soap-opera came to be. This imaginary castaway island of white misery has absolutely no bearing upon real culture whatsoever. And if you're of a comparatively sanguine disposition  it will quickly reduce you to tears of grief. Comparatively ordinary actors pretending to be comparatively ordinary chronic-depressives with cockney accents - what's the point of that?  Dull  dreary  unrelentingly disillusional  and ethnically preposterous. The most popular programme of an apparently diseased and dying nation.  Avoid it like the plague.\n",

Considering how many Bad News Bears films had already been released by 1980  however  I think that this sort of movie was already a tired idea.  A former football player is partially paralyzed in Vietnam and is confined to a wheelchair. The Chicago Bears offer him a PR job but he wants to coach. At the same time  his underage nephew is picked up for armed robbery. We are told that he has already been arrested over a dozen times before and he must now serve some hard time...which turns out to be less than a year!

He overcomes the delinquents' cynicism and earns their respect. His team faces off against a local high school team (yeah right!) and they get their butts kicked. Now determined more than ever to prove himself a worthy coach  he demands a rematch. Will these underprivileged  scrappy kids with hearts of gold be able to improve enough to win the rematch?

Naturally  they turn out to be amazon warriors and capture the men. The rest is pretty predictable.  This movie has everything you'd expect in a bargain basement movie about Africa--the substantial use of often irrelevant stock footage  film of animals that are NOT native to the continent (such as Orangutans  Moose  Coatamundis and Ground Hogs) a white actor in dark makeup playing a native  bad acting (particularly from Trent--a handsome man with the personality of balsa wood)  comic relief (sounding like Chico Marx)  a guy dressed up in a gorilla suit and bikini-clad white women with perms who are supposedly fierce jungle warriors--like a tribe of angry female Tarzans. By the look of it  my assumption is that the movie was made for under $49.95--including developing costs and paying for rental of the gorilla suit! But  what I didn't expect was an IMDb score of 4.9. This is poor  but not that poor considering that this is a schlock production in every possible sense and there is no conceivable reason why the film is rated that high! Now I am NOT saying the film isn't worth seeing--it's campy and stupid enough to make enjoyable viewing--particularly with friends.

Coupled with the fact that I must admit that this film was well acted  it surprises even myself that I cannot recommend this film.  The utter breakdown in this movie occurs about midway through the film. All comedy is instantly lost and the film turns dark. Afterwards  the film plods along.

      "This is one of those wonderful martial-arts movies that begin with two posses of tough gang members facing off in a park; and when the deal goes wrong and the battle starts  it turns out they all know karate and kung fu! The ever-wooden Cynthia Rothrock plays (as usual) a cynical  deadpan  good cop  this time in Los Angeles. She and her police partners are trying to break up a counterfeiting ring  and when that plot line is exhausted  the story just switches over to something else  and Cynthia becomes the personal bodyguard of a wealthy  great-looking tycoon. Within the film's obviously rock-bottom budget  there's some helicopter action  some speedboat action  some car chases  a brawl where Cynthia beats up everyone in a country-western bar  some swimming-pool scenes with bimbos in thong bikinis  and a surprisingly good horseback chase. About a dozen and a half cops get gunned down. A lot of plot twists happen that just don't make any sense; don't worry about them. (And counterfeiting currency is a federal crime  so where the hell is the FBI? I guess they were too busy.) The fight choreography was done by Cynthia Rothrock's frequent co-star Richard Taylor  whose classy and witty presence in front of the camera would frankly have made this a better movie. He also tended to make Cynthia a better actress when they appeared together  and frankly she could use it; she seems tired and bored  and does her best acting in GUARDIAN ANGEL when she is playing opposite a pet dog to whom she delivers bitter drunken monologues. The dog almost out-acts her! She also wears some of the most god-awful clothing any leading lady has ever worn in any movie: loose  baggy-leg jeans with pale acid-washed areas over each buttock were the most shocking. The other actors are all over the map. You can picture many of the minor characters being cast this way: Hey  me and some other guys I know are going to be in a movie. You wanna be in it too? No  dude  I'm serious! Then there are the slumming professionals: the most fun is Lydie Denier  the stunning French model and veteran of Red Shoe Diaries  Baywatch  Melrose Place  and of playing many  many other variations on the sexy French bombshell; here she plays a psychopathic killer as if she were in BAISEZ-MOI or an Alias episode and not some direct-to-cable trash like this. There's also the tall  dark and handsome Daniel McVicar  now a regular on The Bold and the Beautiful  John O'Leary  who has played a dignified old man in dozens of movies and sitcom episodes and does it again here  and Aharon Ipale  the veteran Arab character actor perhaps best known as Pharaoh Seti from THE MUMMY and THE MUMMY RETURNS. For these professionals  GUARDIAN ANGEL must be the most laughable entry on their resumes. I gave this movie a better rating than it probably deserves because my daughters  who are enthusiastic martial-arts students  both like to see a woman kicking ass and having the big action scenes for a change. They're still a bit too young to care what a low-quality picture this really was  and just enjoyed cheering Cynthia on as she did her swivel-legged  high-kicking  stick-fighting thing. If you like this kind of flick  you could probably enjoy it on that level.\n",

      "Like almost everyone else  I became aware of this turkey on Mystery Science Theater 3000. It easily ranks as one of my favorite MST3K episodes of all time. I really couldn't imagine attempting to watch this film on it's own though.........it's really  really  really  really  really  really  really  really  really  really bad.  Miles O'Keeffe stars as Ator  a muscle-bound Fabio wannabe who lives during the time of cave men. We the viewer are asked to suspend our disbelief in that he knows alchemy and chemistry and can manage to build a complete hang-glider in about 5 minutes. Yeah  right! There's also a fairly attractive actress (can't remember her name) who wears a hub-cap as a chest shield. Oh  and I can't forget that wacky Asian side-kick Thong. He had the easiest role in the movie since he doesn't utter one word of dialogue throughout the entire movie. He had to figure out how to make his character interesting without talking.....and he failed miserably.  The film isn't watchable in any way and should be only viewed in it's proper MST3K format. If you watch that version  you'll laugh yourself silly!  I'm HUGE!!!!  Rating:1\n",

      "When Exploiters become evangelist  they still exploit in the name of poverty!   My first reaction after seeing the movie is  God Bless me that I am not eating fish or any non-vegetarian products!   The documentary is about Lake Victoria of Tanzania where numerous varieties of lovely fishes used to live  and one day during 1960s somebody came and injected the mighty fish Perch  who became the exportable commodity for Tanzania to European and Japanese markets. The consequences were severe  firstly all local small and big fish were extinct; secondly the plane that came to take the fish could not travel empty because it does not make commercial/ business/ capitalist sense  so it is filled with arms and ammunition (that is what Europe can give this world); thirdly the pilots (as all migrants and traveling population like truck drivers) has to survive their sexual needs by flourishing cheap local African prostitutes for them; fourthly the brokers  dealers  middle men in the chain (mainly Indian origin business people) get richer and Tanzania's poverty remains the same; fifth poverty drives the children to crime  drugs etc.  The premise to make this documentary was excellent. But has the Director Hubert Sauper succeeded in making a good documentary? It is a big NO.   I say the reasons: Like in India  it requires a higher caste Brahmin to stand up and project to the world  Indian poverty and untouchables; similarly it requires an Austrain born European documentary maker to tell the world the story of Tanzania and its crumbling and ruining economy and poverty. It is the pathetic motive of unaware breeding of that rich class (who have never seen poverty or known poor)  who survives  live  earn and fame like pest hanging on to projecting poverty to the world as soon as they see it. There is nothing more but despise by poor people in African and India who see such images of their.  The intention and motives of the Hubert seems totally lop-sided. The images  characters  locales  interviews are too grave and murky  dark and disturbing. He uses exaggerated ignorance as a voice to present his case. What we feel in the end is pity and sadness for Africans. We also start considering the Tanzania government and people as villainous. May be some westerners sitting in their air-conditioned rooms would find time to discuss and debate about the pathetic living conditions of Africans  but there would be nothing more than that.  The director restrains to show himself even once on the screen  so as not to be identified among the Europeans who exploit this poor country.  This Director Hubert can only survive being exploiters themselves like today's CNN and BCC media giants. Hubert did not have guts or common sense to talk to any Europeans who eat or companies who import these fish products. A totally lop-sided flimsy effort! But I understand the reasons of the same  Hubert just wanted to rake his fame  sitting and smiling with awards in his European comfort.  No more words to spare for this pathetic effort. I hesitantly give the documentary a higher rating 3.5 Stars out of 10  just because the theme was correct; but was pathetically exploited and blown away by amateurish ill conceived director made solely for un-intelligent western audiences! (Stars 3.5 out of 10)\n",

I wanted to like this movie but just could not find anything to like about it. Whatever it was that made The Lost boys so likable was obviously absent here. Altho it tried hard. Plot hooks were clumsily placed amidst what could have been an episode of dawsons creek with dark clothes  and the story arc was going nowhere soon. Very disappointing for me.

      " Airport '79 (or  if you saw it in the UK where it dragged its heels getting released there  Airport '80: The Concorde) was the last and by far the least of the series. The disaster movie was in dire straits in the late70s  what with The Swarm having offered much unintentional hilarity and Beyond the Poseidon Adventure  When Time Ran Out and City on Fire simply offering much boredom  and the desperation to find a new spin on the genre is all too apparent here. This time it's a conspiracy plot  with Susan Blakely's news anchorwoman discovering billionaire boyfriend Robert Wagner has been selling arms to terrorists and the North Vietnamese. Naturally  she decides to tell him everything rather than make the story public  but  he fobs her off by explaining I'm a very rich man. I have everything in life I could ever want. Why would I jeopardise that by doing something so incredibly stupid? Just in case she doesn't buy that line  rather than  say hire a hit-man to kill her on the ground  he decides to do things the smart way by planning to destroy the Concorde while she's flying to Moscow via Paris. I've done a lot of things I've been ashamed of  but I am not a murderer  he insists indignantly on his way to reprogramme a guided missile to destroy the plane. So  nothing incredibly stupid there.

Where the previous three entries all had the look of glossy big-budget entertainments  this small-screen friendly effort (the only one not to be shot in 2.35:1 widescreen) doesn't even manage to make the Concorde look good  which is quite a feat. TV veteran David Lowell Rich presumably got the directing gig because he was fast  cheap and had previously directed TV movie SST: Disaster in the Sky where Peter Graves' supersonic airplane found itself unable to land due to sabotage and Senegalese flu (which was not  intentionally at least  a comedy despite the presence of a young Billy Crystal in the cast) and seemed like the natural choice for what looks like a $14m TV movie that somehow escaped into theatres when no-one was looking.

David Warner's navigator on a diet having nightmares about being chased by bananas  the voice of the Devil (Mercedes McCambridge)  Charo and her Seeing Eye Chihuahua (Dohn miscon-screw me)  Martha Raye and her weak bladder  Jimmie Walker playing the sax in his seat and smoking weed in the john (in the few moments its not occupied by Martha Raye)  Cicely Tyson kissing her credibility goodbye as the obligatory mother with critically ill child and a frozen heart in the overhead locker  airline owner Eddie Albert and trophy wife Sybil Danning occupying the best seat in the house  Ed Begley Jr in goggles  and the Russian Olympic team and their lovable coach Val Avery and his deaf daughter (ahhhh!) on a goodwill tour of the States (who knew about the boycott?). Just to add a touch of The Simpsons to proceedings  Harry Shearer voices one news report in the same tones he'd later use for Smithers.  Highlight? Despite the impromptu wedding ceremony during a crash landing  it just has to be George Kennedy diverting a heat-seeking missile by opening the window  sticking his arm out (at nearly twice the speed of sound!) and firing a flare  while the plane is upside down!

      "Pun intended. This low budget action/horror vehicle for Don Wilson's ability to kick things is the stuff direct-to-video fare is made of.  The plot: Wilson is a humorless vampire hunter who comes under fire from local law enforcement after he is forced to slaughter creatures of the night in view of the public. Police chase him  vampires chase him  he responds by kicking...a lot.  There is a little more to the story  but it is so inconsequential that I honestly can't remember it; I think people actually spoke in the movie  but that's up to debate. The plot is nothing more than a set-up for Wilson to kill as many vampires as possible in the running time  usually by kicking them.  The technical specs are  in a word  anemic. Little color treating  amateurish use of lighting  simplistic use of camera and angle. Blood and gore is noticeably limited  odd for this type of film. The most hurtful of the filming foul-ups is the jarring shift to super-shaky cam during each and every fight scene. If the camera begins to bounce around like a reese monkey on speed  then you know Don is about to start kicking everything in sight.  All in all  this is the kind of bad movie that can be made good with a few friends and a lot of cynical humor. Otherwise  do not watch  unless you really like to watch things get kicked.  3/10\n",

      "(As a note  I'd like to say that I saw this movie at my annual church camp  where the entire youth group laughed at it. I bought it when I saw it on a shelf one year later  if only for the humor I derived from a bad attempt at making an evangelical movie.)  Lay it Down falls short of many movie fans' expectations on several different planes. Most of the problems lie within the impersonal acting. Regardless of the nice cars in the film  or the truth in Christ's sacrifice for you  as a movie AND witnessing tool  Lay it Down hardly delivers.   Most good opinions of the movies are supported by Christians agreeing with the message. While it's easy for a Christian to agree with the points delivered  the audience hardly ever witnesses life outside a cliché. The fighting scene between Ben and his brother is horribly dubbed. And there are at least three blatant typos in the subtitles.  I encourage anyone to watch the movie a second time with the director's commentary on. It really helps you understand just why the movie was written how it was. The director's views on secular society are practically opposite of what would cater to a movie-goer's needs: he shows a pedantic understanding of Nonchristians  as well as some points of religious conflict; most of the editing  he admits  was rushed  but satisfactory; he thought the over-used transitions and themes to be effective; and was completely happy with the acting.   He also inserted motifs that he was rather proud of: -All (read: most) of the names are significant. Ben Destin = Been Destined  Gus Pelman = Gospel Man  Nicky D = Nicodemus. -The car doing donuts is symbolic of the circling nothingness that is a life without Christ. -When Ben leaves on Pete's motorcycle  he crosses his crutches to form a cross.  I'm not making any of those up. He throws around things like this in between saying while street racers and the like blow their brains out with guns  and how God is in control when your born and when your die. Yes  that was not a typo. He really says that.  I have (little) forgiveness reserved for this movie. The cool cars and good message don't do jack to make this movie good. However  the movie was made from a group of unprofessional individuals on a budget less than 1/100th of The Fast and the Furious's  and the time limit was unforgiving. With that in mind  I give it a score of 2/10  instead of the 1/10 I so dearly think it deserves.\n",

      "This film is bundled along with Gli fumavano le Colt... lo chiamavano Camposanto and both films leave a lot to be desired in the way of their DVD prints. First  both films are very dark--occasionally making it hard to see exactly what's happening. Second  neither film has subtitles and you are forced to watch a dubbed film--though Il Prezzo del Potere does seem to have a better dub. Personally  I always prefer subtitles but for the non-purists out there this isn't a problem. These DVD problems  however  are not the fault of the original film makers--just the indifferent package being marketed four decades later.  As for the film  it's about the assassination of President Garfield. This is a MAJOR problem  as Van Johnson looks about as much like Garfield as Judy Garland. In no way whatsoever does he look like Garfield. He's missing the beard  has the wrong hair color and style and is just not even close in any way (trust me on this  I am an American History teacher and we are paid to know these sort of things!). The real life Garfield was a Civil War general and looked like the guys on the Smith Brothers cough drop boxes. Plus  using some other actor to provide the voice for Johnson in the dubbing is just surreal. Never before or since has Van Johnson sounded quite so macho!! He was a fine actor...but certainly not a convincing general or macho president.  In addition to the stupid casting  President Garfield's death was in no way like this film. It's obvious that the film makers are actually cashing in on the crazy speculation about conspiracies concerning the death of JFK  not Garfield. Garfield was shot in Washington  DC (not Dallas) by a lone gunman with severe mental problems--not a group of men with rifles. However  according to most experts  what actually killed Garfield (over two months later) were incompetent doctors--who probed and probed and probed to retrieve a bullet (to no avail) and never bothered cleaning their hands or implements in the process. In other words  like George Washington (who was basically killed by repeated bloodletting when suffering with pneumonia) he died due to malpractice. In the movie they got nothing right whatsoever...other than indeed President Garfield was shot.  Because the film bears almost no similarity to real history  it's like a history lesson as taught from someone from another planet or someone with a severe brain injury. Why not also include ninjas  fighting robots and the Greek gods while you're at it?!?! Aside from some decent acting and production values  because the script is utter cow crap  I don't recommend anyone watch it. It's just a complete and utter mess.\n",

      "I can pretend no knowledge of cinematography or Mr. Angelopoulos. But I know Greece and I love her people. In July my 14 year old son and I traveled to Cappadocia  Turkey in search of some remains of the neighborhood where his great grandfather Iordanis lived until the great exodus of Anatolian Greeks in 1923. Reading the summary of the film (refugees from Odessa) I thought that perhaps I might learn something more about the forced migrations of modern Greeks. If I did not have a home in Rhodes  had I not been to Greece 28 times in as many years  were I not familiar with dozens of islands and cities in Greece and if I had never enjoyed the friendship of these ebullient  life-intoxicated people  I might have believed that this lamentation had something to do with modern Greece. As a professor at a New Jersey State college  let me assure you that I am familiar with the history of the period covered in the film. Indeed  my wife's uncle was murdered by the communists during the communist grab for power. My mother-in-law lived through the Italian invasion and German occupation...barely. These characters on the screen speak Greek  they listen to Greek music but who are they? No  they are not even vaguely Greek. Of course they are not people at all but simply allegories. They are that which the artist invents when life does not entirely fit or is inadequate to his perception of how it was or should have been. All represent some aspect of post WWI Greece that greater outside forces consigned to a fate they didn't deserve. As we joked in the late 70's in America: The Revolution didn't happen. For an ideologue/artist  this is no joke. It's in fact grounds to put us through two and a half hours of torment. And it's all because the various Powers (Eleni's soliloquy of guards in different colored uniforms) didn't allow the generation after the aristocrats of 1919 (Spyros) to follow the call of peace and freedom (the music of Nikos and his fellow musicians  i.e.  the Movement  the Cause). This dark  surreal revisionism smears the true and heroic efforts of the Greek people to sustain their lust for life through the tragedies of the 20th century  to achieve more than any of their Balkan neighbors  to have become so politically evolved and globally integrated.\n",

      "Say what you will about cinema's Wizard of Gore  Herschell Gordon Lewis  it must be conceded that from his first films (1963's trashy Blood Feast and 1964's crackerbarrel massacre Two Thousand Maniacs) to his last (1972's The Gore Gore Girls)  the man remained faithful to his muse  gleefully chopping up the bodies of young men and women for the delectation of the camera. In Gore Gore  for example  someone has been mutilating the pasty-faced and pasty-clad strippers at the Tops & Bottoms Club  and obnoxious ex-detective Gentry is hired by a hotty cub reporter to assist on the case. The film features remarkably annoying and repetitive background music  terrible lighting  abysmal acting  repugnant characters  problematic sound AND  of course  some of Lewis' patented gross-out scenes. Thus  one of the strippers has her face shoved into boiling oil; one has her head ripped open; another has her face ironed and her nippies cut off; and still another has her bum paddled with a meat tenderizer until her entire backside is covered with what appears to be Buitoni tomato sauce. (I could be wrong here; it might have been Ragu.) The film also throws out some fairly lame humor  although some of the lines ARE pretty funny. For example  we learn that the real name of slain stripper Suzie Creampuff was...Ethel Creampuff! A bottle of acid says Made In Poland on it (don't know why  but I thought this was funny). And some of strip club owner Henny Youngman's lines are  of course  amusing. Still  this is NOT the movie to show to Aunt Ethel or Sister Agatha. It is one of the sickest you'll ever see  with only one surefire  crowd-pleasing moment--the title card at the film's conclusion that reads We Announce With Pride: This Movie Is Over!\n",

      "I preface by stating I am a big fan of JJL and NOT one of Patrick. Therefore I watched this to see her performance and of course  it was excellent. I do not feel the director was adequate for the film as several very bad choices were made re: shot angles  blocking  etc. If the director was trying to give it a realistic feel  they failed and lost some good performances because of it. Nearly always felt that the camera was way too static  too far from intense facial reactions -- and so many times when the action depended on the intimacy of lead characters  the dialog was slow and plodding. This easily could have been resolved by cutaways or changes of camera angle. But the impression I got was that the budget was too small and only one camera was used! I also got the impression that perhaps scenes were shot multiple times and the energy coming from the actors was... used up.\n",

      "What annoys me with so called 'science' programs such as these is that it is presented as if it were a FACT that dinosaurs live 'millions' of years ago. Firstly  nobody can even conduct a scientific experiment to prove that the earth is millions/billions of years old. It's a shallow theory based on inaccurate radiometric dating methods with huge assumptions thrown into the evolutionary pot.  Secondly  nobody can prove that evolution ever happened. All Darwin's missing links are still MISSING ! If you look at all the fossils anywhere in or on the earth  they are complete animals of a certain kind eg: a dog or a cat. Nobody has ever found the skeleton of a dog turning into a cat or in the example presented in this series  a dinosaur turning into a bird.  This is utter hogwash. There's more proof that Santa Claus exists than any animal changing into another kind of animal.  All the ideas presented in this series is an attempt to eliminate the idea that the universe and the everything in it  was created.  This series is NOT SCIENCE. It is a religious world view that hides under the banner of science. Science is something we can observe and repeat. What you are seeing here is SCIENCE FICTION.   If you want to watch a science fiction program that has the decency to admit that it's a science fiction program  then rather watch Star Trek or Star Wars.\n",

      "I finished watching Mandy Lane about an hour ago  and felt the urge to come straight home and get up here to warn anyone that's about to spend money on the DVD - DON'T.  The supporting characters are shallow  the failure of acting is higher than that of Matthew McConaughey movies  and up until the end twist  the plot is everything but obvious. In nine out of ten  you can see the next scene coming 5 minutes before it starts. The whole movie is more or less without motive or message  and the half-way revealing of the murderer just plain out kills what little interest you might have left at that point. What could have saved this shallow  tedious movie is some decent splatter  or at least gore worthy of the genre Slasher - It fails there as well.  If you need a background movie to a party that you can jump in and out of without missing anything  I recommend buying All The Boys Love Mandy Lane.  If you're looking to sit down and actually concentrate your eyes on the screen for more than 15 seconds  I don't.\n",

I feel that Fox loved that they broke barriers with the then-edgy Married with Children  but now it's just getting ridiculous. The Loop is a pointless and boring watch  and their edgy jokes just fall flat. In order for edgy comedy to work you have to keep the jokes coming. Family Guy and The Simpons work because there is a constant flow of jokes. Fox needs to pull their heads out of their rectal cavities and quit letting their relatives write this mediocre tripe. I mean  if you're going to invest money into making something entertaining  make it entertaining. Also  stop using no-named actors.

      "I was hoping to like this movie  to settle in for an evening of goofy fun. I like Judy Davis and Juliette Lewis  and the premise seemed off the wall enough to be entertaining.  Unfortunately  I found myself dozing over and over again. Judy Davis gave a fine performance  but had very little to work with. Juliette Lewis was fabulous as expected  but had very little to do. The plot was full of twists that were just plain silly  and as so often happens in movies of this type  nobody acted the way a real human being would act. And  personally  I thought Marcia Gay Harden was totally miscast.  The movie also seemed to shift about midway from a black comedy with touches of farce to a total farce with touches of black comedy. One reviewer here notes that other reviews seem to want this movie to be something different  and therefore decried it. All I can say is that I would have settled for the movie being *something* and sticking with it. This one feels like the director had some grandiose ideas but wasn't able to pull them all off. I give it a 4 out of 10.\n",

      "Supercraptastic slasher fare  which feels overly long at 80 minutes. Years ago  a bunch of gypsies who lived in the caves of a mountain  were burned up in a forest fire. Years later  campers are going missing from the area of the fire. A bunch of horny kids are  of course  en route to this area for a debaucherous camping trip of there own. Despite an ominous welcome from the forest ranger (Jackson Bostwick) the kids troop up to the mountain any way. Before long  the kids start to get picked off by the monster  who remains unseen to the very end of the movie  probably because the makeup was so embarrassingly bad. No surprises to speak of: they get killed in the exact order that the formula for these movies dictates  leaving the final girl to fend for herself  although in a refreshingly downbeat denouement  the final girl ends up imprisoned and impregnated by the monster.  The story itself couldn't hold the weight of feature length  so it was padded out by seemingly endless shots of wildlife and insects  which were obviously shot for another film and inserted here haphazardously as a means of making the movie long enough for a video release. On the plus side  the wildlife footage is rather nice. Also among the highlights are Bostwick talking to a baby deer  a decent rock-climbing death sequence  OK gore  and the Great Jackie Coogan in his final film role  as the bumbling local sheriff. This is a far cry from Charlie Chaplin  but it was still nice to see him. This is for slasher completists only.\n",

      "As much as I respect firefighters for what they do. I was unimpressed and bored with this film. The acting was OK but Joaquin Phoenix was a poor casting choice to say the least.  What bothered me the most about this film was the Celtic music whining on and on and on at the worst possible time in the film. The directing and continuity was pretty bad too!  **SPOILER** For example  after Phoenix's character falls several stories and is badly injured  he can barely move to speak to his captain on the radio. Then miraculously  he manages to crawl across a huge space covered in rubble and fire to punch a man-sized opening in a double thickness brick wall using only a foot-long piece of re-bar???? And to top it all off he then gets ultra weak and busted-up again.  Did anyone also notice that throughout the film  whenever you see shots of Joaquin fighting fires and rescuing people  there is little or no smoke in the buildings. I would think the smoke should be pretty thick in a flame engulfed building.  I also got tired of hearing the search and rescue team yelling I need some equipment over here!!!.  I really thought I would enjoy this film but I found it to be a weak attempt at representing the true life of a fireman. The intention was there but I honestly think that this film could have been so much better. I couldn't help but think that the producer was trying to meet a deadline with this film and had to rush to put it in theaters. More time should have been spent on editing and ensuring there was good flow to the film.  The special effects were impressive in some scenes but disappointing and almost ridiculous in others. Kind of like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie.  Call me critical but I just can't see what's so great about this movie. At least it wasn't as bad as The Whole Ten Yards which is by far the worst film I've seen in recent months.  I really hope there isn't a Ladder 50 in the making!\n",

      "RKO was trying to boost its starlet JOAN FONTAINE when they cast her as a flying nurse who is strong-willed enough to make a doctor (JOHN BEAL) come to terms with running away from responsibilities in this little programmer. TCM aired it as a stepping-stone in the career of Joan Fontaine.  Fontaine is earnest and does an acceptable job  nothing more  and John Beal is okay as her love interest. But it's obvious that PHILIP HUSTON (who has the appearance and cocky manners of a young James Garner) is the actor who should have shared top billing with Fontaine. Whatever happened to this handsome actor? Why didn't RKO promote him  along with Fontaine? He showed skill as a light comedian.  These are the kind of thoughts that went through my head as I watched this rather tepid drama which never quite lives up to the stark promise of its title. The story itself is rather tiresome  only occasionally coming to life because of Fontaine's spirited heroine.  She photographs prettily as the nurse and wears her serious expressions skillfully  suggesting that there was more to be tapped at a future date. Beal never did go on to a distinguished career and his performance here shows why. Strictly lackluster.  But whatever happened to Philip Huston? Evidence here is that he should have had a worthwhile film career.  Trivia note: Watch for Dwight Frye (of Dracula) as the out of control patient aboard the airplane.\n",

      "I really don't know why I'm writting this. I think most people agree that this movie is bad. Well  let me say this:  When I first get done watching some movies  I like them. Then as time goes on  my opinion changes about the movie. this happened with End of Days. I liked it the first time I saw it. I thought it was entertaining. But  a few weeks later  my opinion has changed. So  to resolve this  I watched it again at a friends house. Well  it's bad.  I'm a logic person. If I see a logic hole in a movie  I try to ignore it. If I see two  then I start to get annoyed. More than two and I'm p***ed off. End of Days made me p***ed off after my second viewing.  First off  the movie is a bit depressing. Everything about it is sad. Everything from Arnold's acting to the movie's colors. But dark looking movies don't bother me  but some thing else did...  If Satan can regenerate his wounds  how can you possible kill him in his mortal form? If you shoot him  his skin grows back. If you cut off his head  a new one should pop back up. So question: what's the point of even trying to kill him? I'll tell you why: because this is a stupid movie that has a recycled villain. This isn't the devil my friends. This is a human being reminescent of those Bond villains who give away there entire scheme to the hero.  Like I said it's worth a look  but don't see it twice  because it's crap.\n",

      "Chuck Jones's 'Odor-able Kitty' is the cartoon that introduced Pepe Le Pew to the world",
      " sort of. There are a few key differences between the Pepe we know and love (or hate  in the case of some people) and the character in this cartoon. For one  the disguised cat who Pepe amorously pursues in 'Odor-able Kitty' is distinctly male. Also  Pepe is exposed as a fraud whose real name is Henry at the cartoon's climax  his French accent dropping away when his wife and family turn up. Pepe is not even the lead character here  the focus favouring the put-upon cat who disguises himself as a skunk to scare off his enemies. For the most part  the storyline largely follows the usual format of a Pepe Le Pew cartoon but Pepe's aggressive courtship is lacking the usual wisecracks and straight to camera addresses that make him such a great character. He is also not nearly as handsome as he would become and rather awkwardly animated. In fact  'Odor-able Kitty' is a fairly ugly and clumsy looking cartoon all round. Its main source of appeal comes from its concept which was original at this stage before it became the template for every Pepe Le Pew cartoon that followed. This subsequent development has robbed 'Odor-able Kitty' of any impact whatsoever and to modern viewers it just looks like a rather dull Pepe Le Pew short with a weird surprise ending. As a child  I hated Pepe Le Pew. As an adult  able to appreciate his more sophisticated  verbal and risqué humour  I love the character and most of his cartoons. 'Odor-able Kitty' makes me feel like a child again!\n",

      "I wanted to like this movie  but there is very little to like about it. It starts out with Jean Stapleton and a Randy Newman song in Iowa (Northwest Iowa  I guess)  reminiscent of Norman Lear's Cold Turkey  which was one of the best movies ever made  according to people on IMDb. So far  so good. And the idea of the archangel Michael living at Pansy Milbank's motel on earth? Well  give it a chance  it's supposed to be a comedy. Okay  so far  so good. But Michael does things that an angel not fallen would never do  and that completely blows any credibility the movie might have had. The other characters in the movie don't have much appeal  either. Michael brings a dog back to life  and we're supposed to be in awe of that. The people make up corny country songs. In the end  Stapleton dances with Travolta. Big deal. If she was smart  she wouldn't even be in this movie. When it was over  I thought  Gee  what a stupid  tasteless  boring  corny  sacrilegious movie!

      "Before I begin  let me get something off my chest: I'm a huge fan of John Eyres' first film PROJECT: SHADOWCHASER. The film  a B-grade cross of both THE TERMINATOR & DIE HARD  may not be the work of a cinematic genius  but is a hugely entertaining action film that became a cult hit (& spawned two sequels & a spin off).  Judge and Jury begins with Joseph Meeker  a convicted killer who was sent to Death Row following his capture after the so-called Bloody Shootout (which seems like a poor name for a killing spree  Meeker kills three people while trying to rob a convenience store)  being led to the electric chair. There is an amusing scene where Meeker talks to the priest about living for sex but meeting his one true love (who was killed during the shootout)  expressing his revenge for the person who killed her  Michael Silvano  a washed-up football star who spends his days watching his son Alex practicing football with his high school team (and ends up harassing his son's coach). But once executed  Meeker returns as a revenant (or as Kelly Perine calls a hamburger without the fries)  whose sole aim is to get his revenge  which basically means making Silvano's life a misery.  Let me point out the fact that Judge and Jury is not a true horror film. It is a supernatural action film  with Meeker chasing Silvano  using his ability to change form (which amounts to David Keith dressing up as everything from an Elvis impersonator  a French chef (with an accent as bad as his moustache)  a drag queen  a clown & a stand-up comedian)  a shotgun which fires explosive rounds & an invulnerability to death (although that doesn't stop Martin Kove from shooting Keith with a Desert Eagle)  to pay Silvano back for killing Meeker's wife.  Director John Eyres does not seem interested in characterisations  instead focusing solely on action scenes  which the film has plenty of. But that is the film's main flaw  since there's nothing to connect the action scenes together. The acting is surprisingly good  with Keith delivering the best performance  supported ably by Kove  as well as Paul Koslo  who plays the washed-up cop quite well. Kelly Perine is annoying as the cabbie who tries to help but makes the situation worse.\n",

      "What a terrible movie this was! I made it about 50 minutes into it and started skipping chapters until the end. The plot is nothing special  and the dialog from the movie deviates from the main story so much that your head will explode out of rage. Many useless minutes wasted just listening to characters jabber on about something irrelevant to the plot  AND/OR something that could said in a shorter amount of time. The camera work is shaky  and grainy. It seemed Mr. Milligan needed to take his finger off of the zoom button! I noticed also that at some points during this movie it seemed that Andy was having seizures  and would uncontrollably shake the camera. The splices between scenes were jumpy and didn't flow. The murder scenes were nothing special - incredibly  and laughably fake. Barely any gore  as the title suggests. This movie runs about 1 hour 20 minutes and the murder scenes take up about 1 minute TOTAL of the whole movie - if that. What a wretched piece of garbage this movie was. Andy Milligan is in fact probably one of the worst directors to plague mankind with his talentless directing  and camera-work. Usually  I can make it through really bad horror movies  and laugh about it later. BLOODTHIRSTY BUTCHERS  however  I can't.

      "I'm probably one of the few people who defend and even enjoy Frisk  the project that put Todd Verow on the map  if that is indeed where he is. I appreciated that someone had the guts to take on Dennis Cooper and not back away from the material; Verow fairly rolls around in it. Judging from what he's done since then he's well-suited for that type of material and should probably stick to it. Vacationland  a would-be teen coming out film  is so misguided in so many ways it becomes unintentional comedy  and I'm disappointed I have to report that.  First off  our hero  the high school Senior Joe is far too old in appearance to be playing 18 . When we later meet a man who is supposed to be Joe's teacher it's confusing  as the sweaty-faced guy looks much younger than the student he's teaching. Joe's mother looks younger than he does and doesn't act any older either. Second  in Joe's opening scenes he looked like he was either playing  or actually experiencing  mental challenges. To his credit he got better as the film went on and I figured out he was playing young  but it just wasn't working--it was weird.  It's 15 minutes in before anything is revealed about who  what and where these people are  and why we should care. The second scene in the film is an extended bit of business in a men's toilet room that  considering where the story goes later  is absolutely superfluous; the subplot with the teacher goes nowhere at all  even as a rite of passage for our young hero...one minute Joe is nervously trying his hand at bathroom stall sex (a scene so un-erotic it makes you truly wonder what anyone sees in the practice)  the next minute he's an expert at sexual blackmail and violent double-crossing. This is followed by an extended scene with the character we'll later learn is Andrew  and that's about all we learn about him  other than he's apparently gay but not out yet.  There's a lot crammed in to the 1:44 running time (which is about 20 minutes too long--I can't imagine how it played with the mind-numbingly long and pointless deleted scenes of Joe walking around); a sub-plot copped from Gods And Monsters with an aged patron who spouts rhetoric appros pos of nothing played by an actor who obviously can't remember his lines (he is conveniently dispatched with in a way Dickens might have come up with on a slow week); a mix-n-match almost-four-way between the boys and their girlfriends  a gay-bashing toilet tramp  a would-be wise sage in the form of a nellie queen (and hasn't the nellie queen suddenly taken over the role of the hooker with the heart of gold as most tired stereo-type?) who exists only to be degraded; blackmail  theft  murder  alcohol consumption and abuse of looping music software for soundtrack recording.  What you will NOT find in this movie are any interior establishing master shots; we're expected to imagine we're in an airport  grocery store office and classroom  as all the scenes in these locations consist of close-ups and poorly edited soundscapes to convey the idea of locales that the production must not have been able to afford. One thing they were able to get appears to have been an actual gay bar; either it's the worst bar in the world or there are only about 5 gay men in Bangor  Maine  as the bar never has any patrons in it. Another good chuckle came when the actors were supposed to be yelling over dance music that very obviously wasn't coming from the speakers  but was just more of the droning loop-music of the score.  Plots and characters come and go  emotions are unreadable and the dialog  clearly inspired by Dennis Cooper  is film-speak  meaning no humans actually talk this way. Since we aren't given any information about these characters it's impossible to care about what happens to them; it's as if Joe et al appear out of the ether one day and might simply cease to exist once the credits roll (certainly the character of Joe's sister  a wannabee Jennifer Grey who is Bohemia-crazy  seems to just simply stop  we never know where she is in LA or what her problem is...but again...does it matter?). Visually the film looks very good at times  more a testament to new developments in hi-def video than anything  I suspect. The editing is pretty clunky though (there was one great edit; Joe is posing naked and says  I wanted to play sports  but... and we cut to a shot revealing his butt... ha ha). Composition is also odd at times (I thought I was watching SCTV's parody of Persona when the boys were talking together in bed and visually it looked as if their noses were stuck together for the whole scene!).  One senses Verow is really restraining himself from making a naughtier or somewhat rougher movie like he usually does  and maybe he shouldn't have held back (the frothy toothpaste/sex fantasy worked nicely  I thought  though the tone was out of touch with the rest of the movie)...he produces and directs this sensitive coming of age story much like Herschell Gordon Lewis directed films without gore...porn films without sex in them. I got some unintended laughs out of this and it wasn't boring  it just wasn't very good either.\n",

      "A group of 7 gold prospectors head into a mine that was recently opened back up after an earthquake. Of course  they don't pay attention to local legend that something is down there and killing people. This low budget ($25 000) horror flick has a slight cult following and I'm not exactly sure why (unless it is because it is so obscure). I'll admit the last half hour is pretty entertaining  but the hour getting there is pure torture. Lots of walking and talking and our titular strangeness doesn't appear until 45 minutes in. Even in the extras co-writer Chris Huntley admits it commits the unforgivable sin of being boring. I would forgive them if they were strict amateurs  but this group graduated from USC so I would hope they know an exploitation film should be exploitive. Anyway  like I said  the last half hour is cool as three survivors battle the stop motion monster and there is a cool John Carpenter-like score. I wanted to see more of the monster  but it is literally on screen for 45 seconds.  Even if the movie isn't the best  Code Red DVD has given this great attention. You have interviews and an audio commentary by director Melanie Anne Phillips  producer/actor Mark Sawicki and co-writer Huntley. The tales about how the film was made are pretty fascinating and inspiring (like a cave set being built in a backyard). Even more interesting are Sawicki and Huntley's USC student shorts  which are actually all better than the feature production. Huntley was a pretty talented artist and it is a shame he didn't go on to anything else. Sawicki has worked steadily in Hollywood as a visual effects and camera guy. The film's VHS is kind of legendary for how dark it was and I'm sure this is much better. However  you still get scenes where the only image are five helmet lights bouncing around in the blackness. Safe to say  the original MY BLOODY VALENTINE is still horror film set in a mine champ.\n",

Okay  in all honestly  I didn't know all this  but I took the effort of looking it up and that's the also the least thing the creators of Embryo could have done. Don't worry; I'm not just stumbling over details or being exaggeratedly bitter  as there are several more reasons to state why Embryo is a huge failure. Actual science can be considered as boring and inaccessible  and thus Science Fiction is a cinematic genre created especially to make the otherwise tedious  yet educational science topics more interesting and comprehensible to larger audiences. By depicting ambitious scientific experiments that go horribly wrong  or space missions that encounter evil aliens instead of light-years of void  filmmakers usually manage to entertain people with spectacular special effects and  at the same time  teach them useful little trivia about science. In order to make a good or at least halfway-decent Science Fiction movie  writers and directors only have to comply with one basic rule: DON'T be boring! If they can't fulfill this one condition  the viewer might as well read a theoretically accurate book. Something must have gone wrong during the production of Ralph Nelson's Embryo. The basic premise is potentially fascinating and even involving  as we're all sensitive about saving the lives of unborn babies. There also were some very prominent names involved in the production  like main stars Rock Hudson (Giant  Seconds)  Diane Ladd (Chinatown  Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore) and director Nelson himself was responsible for the acclaimed classics Soldier Blue and Charly. Then what went wrong? Simple. The script is irredeemably boring  clichéd and the whole thing looks incredibly foolish because the lab scenery & scientific equipment is clearly too primitive to achieve any medical breakthroughs with.   Rock Hudson  in a very poor performance  plays a doctor who hasn't put any passion in his research work ever since his wife passed away. When his car hits a pregnant dog on a rainy night  his passion returns and he does everything possible to save the dying animals' fetuses. He manages to keep one fetus alive  impressively accelerates its growth process and trains it to become an extremely intelligent dog. Because his procedure is so successful  Dr. Paul Holliston convinces his friend at the hospital to repeat his tests with the human fetus taken from the womb of a pregnant teenager who committed suicide. The female subject unexpectedly keeps growing at a fast rate  however  and after only a couple of weeks she's a full-grown  ravishing and super-intelligent woman. The good doctor naturally falls in love with her  but the groundbreaking new growth treatment also begins to show horrible side effects... Absolute nothing happens during the first 45 minutes of the film  apart from a lot of implausible and overly melodramatic mumbo-jumbo and one or two deeply impressive tricks performed by the dog. That second half of the film does contain a little bit of (grotesque) action and suspense  but by then the stupidity of the dialogs and the implausible plot-twists already ruined the potentially fabulous Sci-Fi idea. There are some really cool scenes  most notably the chess-showdown between Victoria and Roddy McDowall (in a highly memorable and ultra-obnoxious supportive role). The grand finale is absurdly grotesque and literally on the verge of ridiculous  and it almost feels like Ralph Nelson put in that final disastrous shot because it was the general rule in contemporary thriller & Sci-Fi cinema. The last sequence  including the horrible freeze-frame shot at the end  certainly doesn't fit the tone of the previous 100 minutes of the film. But anyway  my sincere admiration and respect to the dog and his trainers. An animal with such intellect and talent surely deserved to demonstrate its tricks in a much better film.\n",

      "8 days no script that's what the DVD tells you is how the movie was made. It's shot in blurry video that's occasionally used to good effect  but it's really partially naked women sitting around in a room for most of the running time. It is very well acted and this helps a lot. But the killer only shows up once in a long time and the girls/women sit and mope they don't try to escape or do anything too interesting  so the whole thing grinds to a stand still after about 20 minutes. Would have been a good short maybe even powerful. Even for eight days they do very little. Why? Because they had no script. How many movies have been made without scripts. Not too many. I wonder why that is? How many great movies have been made from bad scripts. Not too many. Why is that? Working against this major problem  the direction tries and does some interesting things but with what is essentially nothing. Topless girls shot in dark grainy colorless video sitting around will keep some going for a while but not for the short but too long feature length. Actors again deserve praise  if only there was a script.  Also the video quality  or lack thereof  is really low end  they try to use it to advantage and at times some shots look they are from Miami Vice  the recent movie that is. But that's not intended to compliment Miami Vice or this failed venture.\n",

Don't make the same mistake I did.   The title has nothing to do with the movie. The movie has nothing to do with the real world. The plot has nothing to do with a plot. The acting consists of a guy who wants to be John Cusack  but can't pull it off. The lead is a girl who tries to be Claire Daines. Sadly  she can't pull that off either.

      "Let me preface by stating that I have lived in Louisville  Kentucky all of my life. I grew up about ½ mile from Waverly. In the wintertime we would pull our sleds down Maryman road and cross Dixie Highway to go sleigh riding on Waverly Hill. Many times during the winter of 76-77 we would climb into the Tunnel to warm ourselves. The place was still being run as a Geriatric Center at the time. We would go all the way through the tunnel up the hill to bang on what we thought was the Door to the Morgue. I have to be honest. The only sensation we felt was that we were getting away with something we should not be doing. I would have to say we went up that tunnel over 50 times that winter. Nothing stranger than teen-aged boys acting stupid ever happened. I love the fact that it is getting attention after all these years. One evening when I was young we looked out our front porch and it appeared that the entire hill was on fire. There was an older hospital on the hill that burned down. It burned for hours while the entire neighborhood sat outside and watched. The thing that gets lost about Waverly is that many people survived TB there. Let's face it",
      "The doctors back then did everything they thought was correct to save people. It took a lot of guts for people to work there knowing how contagious TB was. Too much is focused on those who suffered. I also have traveled into the building several times in the early 70's. We would go and visit shut-ins in the Nursing Home through a church youth group. By the way  the doors there were not prison like steel doors with chains and padlocks as portrayed in the film. They were wooden and open",
      "sometimes too open. It did smell of urine and feces and you saw the occasional open gown associated with patients with dementia. It was true that it was closed by the state in the early 80's. A lot of that may have to do with the age of the building or the right guy wasn't paid off. This is after all Kentucky. The part of the documentary that turned me off the most was the piling of bodies into a cart. If I am not mistaken it appears to have been Holocaust footage. That was added for dramatic effect. It left me with a sour taste in my mouth for the filmmaker. I am a skeptic when it comes to Ghosts. I do believe that many around here truly think the place to be haunted. Waverly for me however symbolized a fun place for adventure for a boy with a sled.\n",

Paul says some lines to Joseph  then Joseph stumbles away  the next time you see Joseph  he is cured some how  that information is used to cure the infected  then there is a beach party  the end.\n",

      "I'm sick of the open mind argument. I'm generally quite open-minded  but this sort of line is basically made by people who enjoy things that should not be enjoyed. You know what  there is a reason so many people are disgusted by this. And just because someone out there isn't doesn't make it less so. There is  after all  a reason for the existence of the feeling of disgust  and no amount of open mind or pushing the envelope should eliminate that feeling. Otherwise we're no better than senseless living things.  Back to the film. Another argument is that this film puts women in the roles normally reserved for men  which may be why men don't like it. But just because it proves revolting for more men than would otherwise doesn't make it great. Maybe men shouldn't be turned on by what's dominating the movie industry  but is the answer for women to do the same? Maybe  if you don't like movies  TV  and entertainment having so much sexual objectification of women  so much violence  don't watch them.  And if you're a director  don't make them.  Otherwise  some day someone will ask for an open mind when what happened in this movie happen in real life.  Heck  some people seem to like it so much.\n",

      "I approached this movie with the understanding that it was one of the worst flicks ever made. I sat down to watch it with this mindset  and was pleasantly surprised.  It's not great. It's not even that good; in fact  it's pretty poor. However  it's not as bad as I had been led to believe  by a long shot. It's pretty inept  and  evidently as a cost cutting measure  a lot of stock footage is pressed into service  a lot of which has no apparent relation to the narrative.  What it is  however  is an intensely personal movie made by a man who evidently did not have the skills or the funding to do his idea justice. Before you discount _Glen or Glenda?_ out of hand  examine your own artistic skills. Me  I'd love to be able to draw  but anything I try to sketch comes out like stick men. I'd love to be able to sing  but all I do is frighten young children.  Wood had an idea  and unfortunately he didn't have what it takes to make it work.

      "The blame of this terrible flick lies with the director  Martin Campbell. After viewing a few of his credits in later years  this must have been one of his first directorial gigs. He had a more than decent cast to work with but unfortunately he had no idea what he was doing. There were scenes that made absolutely no sense at all. Where was his head...............was he on drugs? I was looking forward to this movie just because of Oldman & Bacon. Maybe it was a short shooting schedule and Campbell just had to bang it out. I can't imagine that the story that Campbell directed even came close to the story that the writer wrote. Oldman & Bacon  along with the rest of the cast  must have slid under their chairs if they went to the screening. As one poster pointed out  Karen Young did do a pretty good fight scene with Bacon. She really did 'let loose'. It's unfortunate that I have to fill in more space just to stay within the guide lines of what the IMDb requires because I really don't have anything more to say about this uninspiring film.

      "I just can't imagine any possible reasons why Madsen and Hopper wanted to be in this movie after reading the script. They got blackmailed maybe? Or are they that badly out of money? The main problem with the movie is that it's boring. The conversations between Madsen's and Hopper's character are pointless  just like the bored chatting between two buddies while drinking beer on a saturday night. You never feel for any of the characters (although Madsen's psycho killer is very likeable  comparing to the other characters). Hopper always was a good actor  and Madsen does a fine job as the serial killer  otherwise the acting is almost laughable. There are about three scenes in the whole movie where something is actually happening  each of them last about three minutes. Although the talking and thinking about murder and the nature of murderers scenes would have been interesting  if they were scenes in a book. The whole concept would've been interesting for a novel  but a movie just can't bare with a story with that much inner thinking and so little action.\n",

No talk about writers  directors  actors...  It's a cute little adventure story set in a banana republic in Mid America  but the storyline is thin.  All the way through the movie I kept thinking about how much this movie looks like the cut-scenes from some action computer war game. Although the FXs are nice  they all too often are visible. Much like the cut scenes in CGs style like Command'n'Conquer.  You almost instantly know that that particular truck  backdrop  bridge  castle  or jet fighter never existed. The look is smooth and nice  but not up to the standard we have come to expect of Action Adventures today. The movie is lacking a lot of obvious on-location filming.  The acting  storyline is below average and the FXs are nice but not up to feature film standard. I am not surprised this thing went straight to video/DVD.  \n",

Six co-workers at an armored car business decide to steal a large shipment of cash themselves. But  just as they get to first base with their plans  everything unravels quickly. With a plot like this  you'd think it couldn't be too bad  at least for an action movie.

They joke  they laugh  have a few drinks together  etc. Then  we suddenly learn they're planning to rob their own business.

In the last scenes Mike  (Matt Dillon)  goes on a suicidal rampage for no other reason than to kill his former friend. The viewer has no hint before this ending that these men are this ruthless and bloodthirsty. It's utterly unbelievable and B movie is almost too kind for this sort of cheesy plot.

It turns it into movie that with every event; becomes so predictable it's not worth watching. There is no depth to the story and even the acting seems superficial.  It looked like it wanted to be a tribute to firefighters but ended up being boring and pretentious.

      "This was Hitchcock's third Hollywood feature  and it appears he was yet to settle into a pattern of consistency  turning from faithful adaptation of classic novel in Rebecca  to espionage thriller in Foreign Correspondent  and now this romantic comedy in the mould of the screwball pictures of the 1930s.  Hitchcock's formal method  on the other hand  had by now settled into something consistent  so much so that he was unable (or at least unwilling) to deviate from it. It was unwise then for him to step outside his usual genre  and a romantic comedy was particularly inappropriate. In Rebecca it was actually great to see Hitchcock constrained by his producer and the source text  forced to turn his technique to heavy Gothic drama  but for Mr and Mrs Smith there is a huge mismatch between form and content. In other words  Hitchcock was no Ernst Lubitsch.  First  let's look at the romantic angle. The best love scenes in Hitchcock films were wild  passionate and slightly dangerous  the ever fallen in love with someone you shouldn't have? situation  and he was great at depicting that. This is something that makes a much earlier film  Rich and Strange  one of the few Hitchcock non-thrillers that really works. Hitch is not so good however when it comes to a more gentle and familiar love story. A light  tender touch is required and Hitch doesn't have it.  Secondly  take the comedy. Of course  Hitchcock films could be funny  The Lady Vanishes is probably the best example  but only when the jokes were sprinkled throughout the story. The master of suspense simply isn't enough of a comedy director to create a film that has funny bones. He cuts up scenes as he would in a thriller  snappy opposing angles of people talking  inserted close-ups of hands and feet  point-of-view shots  but doesn't allow for comic timing or focus on gags. For example  the business with Carole Lombard's dress bursting at the seems is shown to us with a couple of close-ups  but these are timed more as if he were revealing some crucial plot point  and have no comedic impact. Occasionally Hitchcock's style does roughly coincide with the comedy  for example the arrangement of characters in the scene at the club  where Robert Montgomery tries to make it look as if he is with the attractive  sophisticated woman at the next table  but such moments are few and far between.  Even the cast of Mr and Mrs Smith are not up to standard. I'm not sure this was Robert Montgomery's strength lay  and he is boring here. This was of course exactly where Queen of Screwball Carole Lombard's strength lay  and yet while she is clearly acting well the scenes are simply not geared to capturing comedy performances. Even Jack Carson  who could be hilarious when he was really allowed to let go before the camera  fails to perk things up at all. Of course  neither of these fine comedy actors is helped by the screenplay  which isn't exactly bursting with laughs in the first place  even if the basic story is a fairly good premise.  The only full-on comedy Hitchcock made after this was the Trouble with Harry  and that sort of worked because it played upon his familiar suspensefulness. However it was only when the story could exist independently of the humour  when the basic framework was suspense  as it is in The Lady Vanishes or Family Plot  that Hitchcock was capable of doing comedy well.\n",

      "This very finely crafted film commits the unforgivable (which is ironic  given the film's theme). No one coming into this film knows what they are in for. Worse than that  3/4 of the way into the film  no one still has any clue of what they're in for because everything up to that moment is a different movie.  As a front-row fan of Dutcher's first two films  easily competing for the Best 2 Mormon films to date (competing with Saints and Soldiers and  now  New York Doll--saw that at a screening)  Dutcher had me wanting to see his film for a very long time. I was there. I wanted to believe  believe that I'd see the next great Mormon movie  one that would hold the Numero Uno spot for a very long time. But no. Three-fourths in the film took the sharpest of left turns and dragged me through something that I never wanted to go through. He takes on the Mt. Everest of all moral issues  yea  both of them  with little time or emotional capacity left to adequately address them  but instead waves them both off with a nod towards Jesus as if that will make all things well  instantly. (True it is that Jesus saves. Don't accuse me of not believing that. That's not Dutcher's problem.)  Is the film shot well? Indeed. Do the actors act? They acted their pants off. Was the music appropriate? All but whatever was over the closing credits. Everything about this film was superb  except the story  which was so dank and wrong  that all else doesn't matter. (I learned dank from New York Doll  very decent show  by the way.) The third act of the film was neither desirable nor pleasant nor faith affirming. I know Dutcher was bending over backwards to make it so  but I was so far shoved out of the movie at that point that nothing  no thing  could have brought me back. The preposterous unbelievability of dozens of details in the final minutes didn't help. Anyone who's been on a mission knows what I'm talking about  especially anyone whoSpoiler Alertis familiar with events surrounding someone being sent home from a mission early for moral and/or psychological reasons. It's as if a parallel universe suddenly sprung up where normal rules or behaviors suddenly don't apply.  There are a million things good about this film  but they were created and beautified only to be trampled upon and thrown away in a knee-jerk fit of ooh  this will really get them elitism. Hence  unforgivable. I can only hope that when Dutcher puts the finishing touches on his next film (Falling  apparently)  that he remembers that film critics can only buy so many tickets and that it's the fans that pay the bills. That's why the first God's Army was such an unqualified success.  Dutcher's shock and awe approach proves that when it comes to the Big Issues he is in way over his head  having neither the spiritual nor creative maturity nor business sense necessary to take them on. I praypray!he learns his lesson and that years from now he and we all look back  with a chagrin  and rejoice that he pulled his head out of where the Light doesn't shine and really  successfully  takes on those and other issues and changes the world forever because of it.\n",

      "I'd have little to add to bowlofsoul23's bull's-eye comment here. But as the first Brazilian (born  raised and living in Rio de Janeiro  in a neighborhood just a few miles away from the favela of Vigário Geral  depicted in the film) to comment on U.S.-financed Favela Rising here on IMDb  I get mixed feelings: on the one hand  it's good that the dire situation of Brazilian favelas are getting more attention from filmmakers and the media  both from Brazil and abroad  since local governments seem to have given up a long time ago. One the other hand  it's incredibly frustrating that Favela Rising turns out to be such a missed opportunity for enlightening Non-Brazilian audiences on the issue  because first-time directors Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochary (who are from the U.S. and  understandably  neophytes on the matter) turn the biography of AfroReggae group leader Anderson Sá into a glamorous canonization in this superficial  one-sided  under-researched and misleading documentary. Good intentions  muddled results. Favela Rising looks like a TV-ad  is shallow as a prime-time TV interview  and biased as a promotional video.  Favela Rising feels uncomfortably phony for a Brazilian viewer  and not only because of its hype visual treatment of a bleak reality  and its misplaced feel-good happy- ending. City of God is an obvious reference here  with COG actors Leandro Firmino and Jonathan Haagensen cameoing for no apparent reason other than hype. Favela Rising is  allegedly  a documentary about the AfroReggae group and its leader Anderson Sá  but beware: when you see the scenes shot in favelas overlooking the beautiful Rio shore line  you might as well be warned that Vigário Geral (the home of AfroReggae and Anderson) is located in an area of Rio far away from ANY beach. Strange choice of location  to say the least.  Favela Rising is probably confusing for non-Brazilians  who won't know many of the interviewees (and the film won't tell them either) and will have to wait for the closing credits to find out that many of the songs on the soundtrack are NOT by the AfroReggae Band (though you'll get suspicious when you start to hear Pink Martini  of all people!). They won't know either that important issues were simply left unmentioned: why does the film push the notion that AfroReggae is a one-man project? Why not acknowledge the many partners who supply it with substantial financial and logistic support  like Rio's City Council  private Brazilian corporations  multinational recording companies and international NGOs  without which AfroReggae might not even subsist? Why not state clearly that Vigário Geral is still plagued by violent drug wars  and that its dwellers still live in constant fear of attacks by traffickers and cops? Why not state clearly that many of the archive footage clips showing police violence and corruption did NOT take place in Vigário Geral? HOW and WHY did the kid Richard Murilo finally join AfroReggae? WHY on freaking earth wasn't he interviewed once again at the end of the film?  As for Anderson himself  the film leaves a lot of loose ends for the viewer: what's the story about Anderson having two mothers? Is the baby he holds in his arms his son? Why is he inspired by Shiva? Is he a Buddhist? Why does a Candomblé woman appear on the beach when the films mentions Anderson's miraculous recovery from the accident? Is he a Candomblé follower? Why not let him explain the contradiction of starting a group that fights drugs and simultaneously praises Bob Marley? If AfroReggae is also a pride-building movement for black people from favelas  why are the girls in the AfroReggae band limited to booty-bouncing routines? No  you won't get any answers to these questions either.  Instead  the filmmakers are interested in turning Anderson Sá into a composite mix of pop-star  Malcolm X  Gandhi and Christ (check out that last image of the statue of Christ the Redeemer atop Corcovado hill  immediately after showing Anderson miraculously walking after his surgery). And that's the WORST thing the filmmakers could do to Anderson and his cause: turn him into a special CHOSEN one (by the time they show his surgery scar  you're ready to believe it's a mark from God).   Because what's remarkable about Anderson -- who's the most ordinary guy you could ever meet -- is that he helped change his environment NOT by being special but by copying and adapting winning projects (like the Olodum movement in Bahia  among others) to his own community  with strong support by friends  artists  intellectuals  politicians  businessmen and the media. If you're not fluent in Portuguese you probably won't notice that Anderson isn't particularly bright or articulate (unlike his sharply witty partner José Junior)  as much as he isn't particularly talented as a singer  lyricist or musician. Yet his ordinariness might have been the film's true inspirational core: to show that ANYONE with idealism  perseverance and steady support can in fact contribute significantly to his or her community  no need to be Jesus incarnate. Because what really matters is the movement -- AfroReggae -- not the guy  see? Haven't we had enough of personality cult?   By the end of Favela Rising  you probably won't know much more about Rio's favelas than you did when you walked in -- you'll just have SEEN what some of them look like.\n",

      "If you read the book before seeing the movie you may be disappointed like I was. The book was great and I was sure after seeing the movie preview that the movie would be great as well  however I felt like I was watching a movie where the director and cast did not even read what these characters where like. The movie is short and they do not really ever make us feel that these people were truly in love and felt like sole mates. Even if the movie did not go in the same direction as the book at least they could of made the romance between these two characters feel more intense. I think both Diane Lane and Richard Gere were perfect for these two characters and they have good chemistry however they just did not develop a long enough storyline for us to see how they longed for each other. The book was true love story and I think this movie could of been a lot better.\n",

The basic idea of the movie (or let's say the first half of the movie  since I don't know - or care - how the second half goes) has been done before  most notably in 9 to 5  and a comparison between the two shows how thoroughly Tingle gets it wrong. You need to feel things are spiraling out of control in a way that makes you feel events are inevitable  and you need well-defined  interesting characters who you care about  and you don't have that. Not the worst movie I've ever seen  but it never grabbed me for a second.\n",

      "Of all the movies in the history of movies I can't imagine someone sitting down and saying  I want to spend X amount of dollars (or pounds sterling) to remake that flawed classic film called Breeders. Lots of stories have been turned into films about meteors coming to Earth with something sinister lurking inside. Why not put your money into making a spectacular 3D remake of It Came from Outer Space instead? Why look for a dingy nudie flick that existed only for the purpose of showing off a rubbery set of monsters and some naked coeds? Was the script for the 1986 version of Breeders so inspiring that these producers felt it had to be done again and this time done correctly? When you come down to it  the only reason this film exists is to show off Britcom cutie pie Samantha Janus. But if you're gonna make a skin flick and exploit Sam Janus in it  you'd better have her more naked than this and naked more often than this if you want to succeed.  Meteor lands ... monster escapes ... coeds duff their clothes ... monster eats people ... and another what if? ending ensues.  Honestly  I never thought I would ever recommend the original Breeders over any other film but this would be the one to come in 2nd Place to it.\n",

My 2 year old was asking me if all cows have udders and trying to explain to her that this is simply not true and seeing the movie only confused her more!   In addition  the violent theme scared my 2 year old. They made the coyotes ferocious looking and this has instilled a fear of coyotes into my daughter. I know coyotes for a fact are not ferocious and are natural predators. The mother and son who were sitting in front of us were shouting  Kill him  Kill him  yea in a particular scene in the movie where good vs evil per say  It is a Lion King rip off and they should stop using big name actors for a lame movie.

Kubrick had good reason to try to make this film dissappear from the map: it looks like an Ed Wood film. It has strange narration  cheap shots  bad dialogue  ominous music reminiscent of your 50s sci-fi/horror flick  and what looks like relatives of the cast of Reefer Madness going insane for no reason.  Sure  you can see an undeveloped Kubrick in there. It is a psychological/horror study of war. The characters became dehumanized and insane. There are people playing more than one role. There are constant shots of the faces and particular facial expressions of different people. And there are a few interesting shots around there. But really  this is a mess.

Certain little details  such as the misuse of the word hoplon for the Greek hoplite shield and the mispronounciations of various names and words  really ate at me.  My guess would be  that because Last Stand of the 300 was aired the eve of the theatrical release of 300  the History Channel was only trying to ride the coattails of the movie's hype.  If you're looking for a depiction that's historically accurate in all respects possible  you'd have better luck elsewhere.\n",

      "Destroy All Planets winds up settling for 'destroy all Tokyo' by film's end  as a space monster resembling a giant squid falls to the reptilian furnace known as Gamera. Actually  Gamera is saving Earth right from the get go  knocking out Varian Space Ship #1 even before the first set of film credits roll. The scene switches to a Japanese scout camp where we meet a pair of meddlesome young heroes  Jim and Masao  who take part in Gamera's exploits after being kidnapped by the aliens and beamed aboard their ship in an electrified bubble shield.  It's pretty startling to see the boys convince a scientist to let them operate a newly invented submarine that might be defective. Previously boy genius Masao had wired the unit to run in reverse direction of it's controls  but Dr. Dobie didn't think about checking that out as a possibility. At least that prepared the boys for interfering with the alien space ship's controls by playing switcheroo with a bunch of triangular blocks.  When boss alien Viras says 'Activate the Videotron'  hang on to your seats for rehashed footage from earlier Gamera movies where he battles Barugon and Gyaos. These take up quite a bit of screen time  but are no match for the fast forward button if you want to get on with it. For the longest time Viras addressed an invisible crew  and when they finally appeared  they were Orientals who could fly - imagine that!  Seeing as how these movies were made for a juvenile audience  it's surprising to see how gruesome some of the scenes are. Gamera drawing blood comes to mind  and how about the pair of space crew members being decapitated. When squid tentacles started emerging from the headless bodies I made a connection to the 'Alien' films; having the individual units merge to form the giant Viras was a neat device.  I guess the appeal for young kids might reside in identifying with the two young heroes who make friends with a giant monster  move around pretty freely on an alien space ship  and get to have whatever they want with the help of alien telepathy technology. Seeing as how the movie was presumably made by adults  it could have been a simple case of wish fulfillment.\n",

      "I liked all the Lilo and Stitch movies. The TV series weren't that great  but I put my opinions of the series aside when I watched this movie. And I must say... It was bad.  One thing I found disappointing was the animation. Yes  you heard it. The animation. I found its quality greatly degraded since the first movie. Its quality was only as high as the TV series'  something which I did not expect at all. If you're looking for eye candy  don't expect anything much here. Also  the animation failed to portray any serious moods. Even in the supposed sad scenes  I didn't feel anything for the character  another downgrade from the first movie.  The next  was the absolutely horrible voice acting. I found it very  very unconvincing  and wondered why  Disney  with all its riches and glory  couldn't afford voice actors with real talent. The voice actors' skill were just as annoying as the one in the series. I tolerated the one in the series because  hey  who wouldn't be tired out when made to voice act for so many episodes? Heck  I don't even know how many episodes there are (Theoretically  there are 624  but I just can't believe that). However  I thought that the voice acting would improve in the movie  and I was put down in the face by the truth  that what they could do in the series was already their best.  Next  was the horrible script. It was cheesy beyond redemption  and the writers just try too hard. They try to put some jokes in  but I just found them annoying. Maybe it wasn't the voice acting  but the cheesy dialogues that ruined the sound section. (On the upside  the soundtrack wasn't too bad  and matched the mood quite well.)   Fourthly was the problem with the storyline. I predicted everything  and the storyline was what made the characters so unoriginal and unlikeable all of a sudden. You have the aliens get new positions and responsibilities inouter space. After the initial hype  they realize that they actually didn't like it and miss their old life.   Meanwhile  the evil villain gets broken out of jail after a very 'action packed' action scene and breaks in to Jumbaa's lab to steal his experiment. The experiment was then cloned into 100 others and the hamster wants to conquer Earth. When the main characters find out  they try to stop the evil hamster but gets confronted in some cheesy final showdown against the experiment and owns him in an extremely lame excuse for trying to make the series to look cool. The characters then give up their new privileges and return to Earth to resume their life. Seriously  how many other movies has used that ending already? The that storyline was extremely short and formulaic  so don't expect too much from it.  So Disney has failed in sound  graphics and storyline. The only charm of the series was the original characters  and how they managed to retain the 'feel' of the characters  but even that wasn't able to save the movie. I tried to like it  I really did  but I give it a rating of 4/10. Another Disney failure.\n",

But as the film runs along your disappointment increases inevitably.  Ordeal by Innocence is a dull and at times even boring film that doesn't raise at any moment. Nothing interesting happens all along and even the final revealing of the facts lacks surprise and intensity (wether you guessed or not).

      "I have to agree with what many of the other reviewers concluded. A subject which could have been thought-provoking and shed light on a reversed double-standard  failed miserably.  Rape being a crime of violence and forced abusive control  the scenes here were for the most part pathetic. It would have been a better idea to cover short glimpses of what was happening and let the audience imagine the deed. And the victim's laugh with the cops  when he aborted his police complaint  seemed as genuine as that of the cops. No awkwardness  no hesitance to merely join in. I don't know if this was bad acting and or bad directing but someone missed the point entirely. As for his half-a**ed supposed search for his attackers  pathetic. They should have skipped most of the sex scenes - another monumental failure in themselves  and had him meet Colin Friels when he first went to the police. The story could have then been drawn forth with good dialog and the occasional flashback - and saved by the superior acting and presence Colin Friels - the only reason I watched this movie - brings to any project he does.  The only concrete revelation of this movie  is  it was crap.\n",

The sound is terrible  going from too low to hear the conversations  to blaring sound in seconds.

      "The topics presented are very interesting; suburban culture  suburban sprawl  public transportation  oil & gas depletion  energy dependence  alternative energy sources  etc.  The problem is that this is a pure and shameless propaganda piece. One viewpoint is presented  then hammered upon the viewer over and over. You see the same handful of 'experts' repeatedly making their case. The supposed 'narrator' starts off sounding like a news reporter  but by the end even he is preaching the film's dogma.  The dark side of the film is not so much the gloom and doom message about oil depletion  but the sense that the folks in the film are actually wishful for a post-oil society and all that it entails. They paint this picture of a utopian society where we all return to the self-contained local village model; walk to work  shop locally  grow our own food  and generally live an idyllic 19th century lifestyle. For them  the post-oil society would seem a grand vision of a better world. It would certainly spell the end of globalization  and better still  the end of Walmart. I will give them some credit for applying actual math in exposing the weaknesses of several over-touted alternative energy sources  including ethanol and hydrogen.

      "There are so many things wrong with this movie that it is hard to pick just a few. Let's start with the silly and annoying songs. Like Ride Little Cowboy which just tended to accentuate the city-slickers look of Klinton Spilsbury. The silly kiddie cowboy songs going on in the background during the movie hurt any credibility or momentum that the story had going for it.  I had seen the media hype before this movie was released  and I saw Klinton Spilsbury interviewed on various TV shows  and he had a very soft  sweet  lilting voice. His body language was not exactly what people remembered who were fans of Clayton Moore and the Lone Ranger TV series. Spilsbury did not help things by acting like a diva and talking trash about Clayton Moore after the Producers got an injunction prohibiting Moore from appearing at Conventions and other events as the original Lone Ranger. Clayton Moore was not even allowed to sign as Clayton Moore  The Lone Ranger. He could only sign as The Masked Man. The incredible amount of negative publicity that this move gave the film was only added to by the petulant attitude of Spilsbury who was very quick to tell reporters that Clayton Moore would be quickly forgotten once the movie came out!   Sadly  even after the movie was a total flop  the company that owned The Lone Ranger refused to lift their Injunction against Clayton Moore  and he was never again permitted to sign anything except as The Masked Man and he could not don his black mask at any public appearances. Between Spilsbury's diva personality and the negative publicity the movie got  it certainly did not help to make a good impression on the public. Worse yet  a few weeks before the movie was finally released  the news was leaked that Spilsbury's voice in the movie had been over-dubbed by James Keech because the Producers thought that Spilsbury did not sound very convincing as a cowboy. The ridicule and derision that this news brought on the talk shows and comedy shows of that era put the last nail into the coffin.  But then there was Merle Haggard narrating his way through the movie. Apparently  the Producers were hoping that the macho image of Haggard (one of the Outlaws of Country Music) would add credibility to Spilsbury as The Lone Ranger. The narration by Merle Haggard was just another annoyance that audiences had to deal with. At times Haggard rhymes his narration  and it sounds like some weird kiddie movie. Combine the rhyming narration with the Ride Little Cowboy songs and any credibility that Spilsbury could have mustered was destroyed by Haggard and the soundtrack.  Tonto was played by Michael Horse  and as others have pointed out  Horse had a lot more personality than Spilsbury. In fact  perhaps because of Spilsbury's allegedly combative attitude during filming  it seems like Horse was given a lot more dialogue and screen time than anyone would have expected of Tonto. Tonto takes charge and often is the leader instead of the Lone Ranger. I was expecting (or hoping) that Billy Jack would make a cameo as Tonto's brother (it would have made the movie a lot better). Horse is not only more interesting than Spilsbury  but he says more and has better scenes. Perhaps it was a case of Horse stealing the show from Spilsbury. However  since the movie was so wretched  Horse did not get much recognition. Unlike Spilsbury  Horse has had a very productive career in the film industry.  Perhaps the last negative about this movie is the Powder Blue outfit of The Lone Ranger. The material that was chosen for Spilsbury was more powdery blue than what Clayton Moore normally wore at appearances. That choice of color for the outfit just made Spilsbury look more effeminate in his role. The comic book version had shown The Lone Ranger also wearing a red shirt and black pants  and that alternative outfit would have helped Spilsbury look more convincing as The Lone Ranger.  The supporting cast mostly mailed in their performances. They all look as if they were working on a TV episode and nobody seemed very convincing. Even the villain  Cavendish lost his edge due to the people around him. Overall  I feel sorry for Spilsbury. Not only did he do a terrible acting job  but it is obvious that the production and publicity were horrible and effectively sabotaged any chance the poor guy had. Even if he had been an excellent replacement for Clayton Moore  I doubt that the movie would have done well as a result of the other factors. As it stands  this film is funny in a sad way.\n",

      "This is Jonas Quastel debut as a director and to be honest  it shows. It looks like he threw in every type of camera trick that he learned in film school to try and add some style to a badly written script  which he helped write! Film has Lance Henriksen and a group of others searching the pacific northwest for a plane that crashed that his daughter was on and also a special machine his company has built that he wants to also retrieve. The first 5 minutes of the film is either blurry or shaky or out of focus! Quastel tries to capture the Blair Witch mode with these type of shots and they grow tiresome very quickly. And there is also the POV shots that are right from Wolfen and Predator. These shots are from the point of view (POV) of the Sasquatch. The editing is very choppy at times as a scene seems to shift right in the middle. I have heard this film was shot in about 12 days and I suppose instead of Starting back to one they just restarted without stopping and edited the scene together. And the rest of the film is fade-outs from one scene to another. They're are so many scenes that fade-out that I lost count. Now  the nude scene with Andrea Roth. Its not her. you can easily see its a body double. And you know your watching a bad B movie when in the middle of the pacific northwest a hot chick decides to go to the nearest hot spring and bathe! ********SPOILER ALERT********  And the Sasquatch himself is not bad when you don't really see him and he's just a blurry image behind some trees or bushes but when you finally see him at the end your of course disappointed. First of all  he's not that tall. The actor who is playing Sasquatch is only hairy in certain spots on his body. Its a partial suit! And he's bald! I have heard that a make-up person died during filming and maybe that explains why the costume looks hastily made. Some of the sound effects that are coming from the Sasquatch are nothing more than the familiar lion roars that we have all heard in other films. I do have to admit that Henriksen is not to bad. Yes  he's working with bad material but he has one of those interesting faces that can actually enhance certain moments of the film. People keep saying that a good Bigfoot film has never been made but I disagree. I have always said that The Creature From Black Lake is a good film and I highly recommend that one.

The rape scene itself is shot in all it's gory detail with all the male and female organs and their interactions clearly visible to the camera.

A series of crazy  meaningless and wild killings follow  the girls seem to enjoy every murder more than the one before. One poor guy gets shot in the ****hole. There are good doses of sex thrown in between the numerous killings.  The movie is not the most violent I have seen  I would say Saving Private Ryan probably had more violence in it. If violence is what you are looking for  then there are lots of other movies out there. And if it's sex you are out for  then I would suggest one of those XXX ones.

      "If there's one word I can associate to this movie  its 'embarrassment'. It must be embarrassing to everyone associated with the movie  to actually watch it in a theatre. Everything - the script  screenplay  dialogues  song lyrics  direction - shoddy  lousy.  Saw this movie when I was a kid. Liked it then  mainly because it was a fantasy  a superhero-movie. Its a not-so-explored genre in Hindi cinema. The attempt deserves credit  but that's all there is to it. Sashi Kapoor seems to have been in a great hurry in making the movie. Can't understand the reason behind casting foreigners as Hindi-speaking characters  who can't even get the sync right (nothing to say about the dubbing). The screenplay is terrible. The editing even more. If one follows the dialogues closely  one can detect grammatically-wrong sentences (which completely alter the intended meaning). Nothing special about the music.  The biggest embarrassment must be for the Censor board. There are a couple of nip-slip scenes in the movie  one of which is absolutely clear (so much so that I can't even think of a metaphor). The director missed them. The editing team missed it. And the censor board missed it too. So much for the no-indecent-exposure-on screen motto. The officials probably fell asleep while watching the movie.  Can't think of why Amitabh went with the role. It might be because he was a good friend of the Kapoors. But the role hardly has anything for him. With wonderful roles in Hum and Agneepath behind him  he couldn't have followed it up with a worse one. There are a couple of heroic scenes  really worthy ones. But otherwise  they're embarrassingly unbelievable (arrow-catching for instance.. it probably could've been better with CGI  but it was '91..).  Dimple and Sonam do not exactly set the screen on fire. Shammi Kapoor and Rishi Kapoor give an inspired performance  but their scope is limited. Amrish Puri is his usual self in the role of a fairy-tale villain (letting out the villainous laugh every now and then).  On the whole  an interesting concept. Could have been a lot more better.\n",

I can see this as entertainment only if you get a room full of stoned college kids watching it like it were Rocky Horror Picture Show. Imagine some of the stuff you saw on Blazing Saddles  like Mongo knocking the horse down or the old lady gettinf stomach-punched. Now imagine the producer wants you to take those scenes seriously and you get the gists of this disaster.\n",

      "*Criticism does mention spoilers*  I rarely make user comments  but this is one movie I have no problem slandering. This movie stinks  and its mediocre of rating of 6 and a half stars is probably too high for such pulp. The Bone Collector is not at all the same calibre of film that Silence of the Lambs or Seven were  despite what its ad claims. This is a perfect example of how not to make a thriller. The pace of this movie was extremely slow- I actually left for about 10 minutes half-way through and came back at the exact scene with the exact same character with absolutely no progression (I refer to you the part where Angelina Jolie's character debates Denzel about cutting off a corpse' hands). The movie is not at all scary  but tries to compensate this with a love-subplot albeit sexy Angelina Jolie's character and Denzel Washington's. Of course  what you get is something comparable to that of the mentor-student relationship as seen in the brillian epic Silence of the Lambs with Hannibal Lecter and Starling  however  even this lacks all effectiveness and I was personally routing for the villain to kill Denzel off so as to avoid hackneyed giggles between the two. With such a crappy movie  I was half-expecting a plot-twist or some sort of spectacular situation to occur at the end to give the movie some credit- things that mediocre movies like Arlington Road and Scream pulled off. Anybody with a 4th grade education can see the ending how will be resolved ( a situation which mimicks Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window). The cliche of having the killer explain his motives was uninspired enough  but the reason was so ridiculous and stupid it had me spewing latte over the screen. Esoterically speaking  I even think the murderer's intention was completely lost as Denzel happily recovers from his loss over the proverbial 'chess game' and gets with his pet project  Angelina.  If you are a fan of movies with original ideas and genuinely dynamic concepts (like I am)  you will not appreciate this film. If you have not attended a single movie in your life and would like to catch-up on every single Hollywood cliche ever borne (the late-night knock on the window from somebody else but the murderer  the ridiculous serial-killer to prime investigator relationship  the horrible 'woman trying to get by in an all-male dominated workforce aka SOTL)   see this movie....but even then its too slow-paced and you'd be bored.\n",

      "I have read all of the reviews for this direct to video movie. I can agree that the movie is not Armageddon or Deep Impact quality. Nevertheless  if you are looking for a way to pass ninety minutes or so  then this is a movie that is bearable.  I started looking at the film early in the AM hours as I was doing some geek stuff. It was very nice  because I was able to switch back and forth between what I was doing and watching the movie  with out missing a beat. It is a predictable movie  and the acting is not up to par for some of the veteran actors (for instance  Dennis Hopper).  But I should point out that I paid only $2 (US) and as the old adage goes: You get what you pay for! If you are looking for some deep meaning movie that will have you have to watching it over and over again  then this is definitely the long video. On the other hand  if you looking for something to pass the time  then there is nothing wrong with Tycus (Which incidentally was called Comet: Final Impact in Mexico where I found this video).\n",

      "Although I'm not too much of a religious person  I still had relatively high hopes for this movie  as it does have the amazing Steve Carrell  and its prequel  Bruce Almighty  was actually a creative and clever Christian-themed comedy. However  Evan Almighty comes nowhere near this originality and freshness that the original has  and can't decide whether it's a comedy or a sentimental movie about faith and family values. If it had chosen one clear path of which of these themes to focus on  it could have lived up to its potential  but instead the result of mixing the two is a film that has a very flat and dry sense of humor  cheesy dialogue and motifs that attempt to give the movie profundity  but instead practically insults the intelligence of the audience  and also a very confused and clouded presentation of the movie's opaque message. It was very obvious that Evan Almighty was very poorly written  there are numerous plot holes and elements in the movie that make absolutely no sense. For example  although a large variety of exotic animals from all over the planet swarm to Evan as he builds the ark for their salvation from the flood  is their inclusion really necessary when the only flood that happens in the movie is downtown Washington D.C. and a suburban neighborhood  meaning they are at no risk of being wiped out? The filmmakers it seems lacked the originality to modernize the Bible story whatsoever  and instead just had it take place in a present time without changing anything to the plot  leaving many elements that just don't add up such as this and make it obvious of the idiotic motifs and writing within the movie. Overall  this work is tragic in that the acting talent of Steve Carrell and Wanda Sykes isn't exhibited because of the bland characters they portray  and that it was so poorly written that it skews and clouts many of the film's attempted themes  and makes a mockery of the first film. Finally  Evan Almighty also is an insult to the brilliant actors in it and any halfway-intelligent moviegoer  in that it fails both of them miserably.\n",

      "Where to start with 'Speck' the true story of Richard Speck  a killer of eight nurses in the 1960s. Director Keith Walley has worked on a few of the extremely low budget Full Moon Releasing movies (such as Birth Rite) and here works from a script by (at the time) Full Moon regular Don Adams. Unfortunaly whilst the film seems like a accurate portrayal of the horrendous crime the script isn't great  perhaps because the real Speck's ramblings were not terribly interesting!? Despite the care that has been taken to make this authentic it wreaks of a cheap cash-in of the acclaimed cinematic serial killer movies of the same period (such as 'Ed Gein'). Filmed in a dirty brown  not quite sepia  for the most part and narrated by star Doug Cole the film fails to present the horror of the crime because the narration is irritating  the colouring distracting from the story and the crime  though gruesome and upsetting to watch  is merely that and no editorial work seems to have occurred on what is pretty much a very poor quality camcorder viewing on the events. There is no examination of the motivation or of Speck's life really  just a cheap shot at a gruesome crime. Released by Full Moon there is little evidence of Full Moon's better output here  Charles Band ignoring his own rule that his films feature fantasy killings (e.g. dolls  monsters and so on) and not quite knowing what to do with this new reality. Incidentally Band introduced a special label for these films called 'Shadow Entertainment'. Band has said that he regrets the period of Full Moon output alongside Tempe Entertainment (whose Creator J.R. Bookwalter and regular Danny Draven also speak very badly of Charles Band). The Tempe era features uniform Apple Mac editing and brutal hand-held camera filming  very much like a home movie. Speck retains these qualities and whereas Witchouse 3  for example  managed to use these well  Speck is merely boring and gross.\n",

I was lead to people it would be more drama and more facts about the true story it's based on. Instead i spent over an hour watching middle aged mean break the law and take drugs.  It's abit like football factory but with no real storyline and not a good ending. After watching the film i was left wondering What was that film all about? If you like films with no real storyline and a lot of drug taking and swearing then this is the film for you.  I'm a BIG fan of mob and gangster movies but this film did not live up to the hype. I can see where the writer was trying to go with the film but it never reached it's destination.One of the worst British films that i have ever watched. If only the movie had more of a storyline this would have bad an excellent movie.\n",

      "The movie was pretty bad. It's not so much a script problem. It's just that the movie is really boring in terms of pacing. The movie just seems to plod along at a slow  agonizing rate. The story in San Franpsycho is that there's a serial killer on the loose who is killing morally corrupt individuals (maybe I read too much into it  but hey  it's my nature apparently) after The San Franpsycho kills a pair of people under the Golden Gate Bridge we're introduced to one of the main characters of the film: Joe Estevez (brother of Martin Sheen) as a curmudgeony cop named Bill Culp. Bill is currently trying to hunt down the killer (seriously he doesn't have a name  he's just The Killer)  and he is trying to coerce a local news reporter named Rita to help him with his investigation  Bill is the stereotypical hard-edged cop and he threatens Rita to throw her in jail for obstruction of justice. Anyway a few scenes pass by and suddenly Rita finds a letter left by the psychopath (He's a cold blooded psychopath!) and she has a change of heart and tells Bill and his partner Joe about it and help them with the investigation.  The movie tries to be a taut murder-thriller  but sort of just fails at that. It's much like the movie The Black Dahlia it tries to be tense but it just is unbelievable in terms of that. The movie tries to be serious throughout  but it has scenes like where The Killer masturbates (obviously a fan of gore porn what with lines like: ooh blood on her or something to that effect) and Joe Estevez hitting the table going: He's a cold blooded murderer! I admit to chuckling more than once at the movie  even though I'm sure it was intended to be a deadly serious movie.  One of the only positive points the movie has going for it is the fact that I didn't pay money to see it (huzzah netflix). And it's sad because I could see some good in their movies after watching The Damned. Sure the movie had its fair share of flaws  but it was enjoyable. Sadly though San Franpsycho has nothing going for it. Granted it has an okay script it's nothing too grand  but it could've been interesting. Instead what you get is a murder thriller that fails to thrill or have even vaguely enjoyable deaths. Also the other reviews claim that the movie has a great twist ending that's shocking apparently I was watching a different movie because by about the one hour mark I sort of figured out what was going to happen. The ending didn't shock me in the least bit. I would go on insulting this wreck of a movie but I don't think I will. Long story short this movie is a boring uninspired thriller (I use that term loosely) that fails to have the Hitchcockian thrills that another reviewer claims to have a predictable ending  bland deaths  acting with all of the emotion of a plank of wood  and a decent soundtrack.  I'm sure others will try to defend this with the usual: It was a low budget movie  they did the best they could with such a low budget  and all that other nonsense. But when you get right down to it there was very little that they could've really spent that budget on  there was very little special effects work  the soundtrack sounds like it might've been recycled from Hood of the Living Dead or The Damned  and it's the same damn crew from those two films. This movie really reminds me a lot of another low budget flick that was no good  and it was called Mr. Jingles  the two are about the same quality  they fail to deliver anything close to enjoyment and should fade quickly into obscurity.\n",

      "I had been amazed by director Antal's Kontroll back in 2003. His first American project  Vacancy  was less impressive but a decent start. Armored is his second feature and while the visual signature is recognizable  the film never rises above the level of a B movie.   It's a shame because the main premise has all the ingredients for twists and turns and the ensemble cast featuring many quality actors should be able to deliver. Antal could have made a great heist film but instead goes for an action flick. Then again he could have shot a cool action flick but it doesn't really deliver in that department either.   What you are left with is one implausible situation after another  a group of poorly sketched characters bicker and fight over a sum of money. If you look past the sharp cinematography  cast and the tight music score  you're left with what could have been a below average direct-to-video featuring Van Damme or Seagal.   This was probably the most disappointing movie for me in quite some time.\n",

      "As a Canadian History major  my first thing to say : HISTORICAL FACTS ARE NOT ACCURATE! How can a producer do that? The deportation of the Acadian wasn't in 1759 when we see Franklin in London  but in 1755! How can he pass that in the movie? The scenes in Londo were useless too. Then for the story for anyone that read Les Anciens Canadians  you have the story line right there. It's the story of La Coriveau  that witch. Add a love story too and a tragic relationship between mother and daughter ending. Sure  it brought tears to my eyes. But that's it. Then there's the fact it's apparently set up in Québec City  but it's mostly shot at the Forteresse de Louisbourg. Sure it's a historical site and it's accurate to the time  but it was obvious that the scenes were not all set in Québec City. Overall  if you're looking for a documentary of New France  go get Candad : A People's History  a real documentary on the history of Canda and NEw France. If you want a love story that will bring you tears  a story set up in a wonderful forest  watch New France.\n",

The above title was superfluously added later on since there exists another similarly titled 1961 movie starring Richard Basehart which was Hammer Films' Michael Carreras' one and only stab at the Western; the genuine Italian title was originally translated as HIS NAME WAS SAM WALBASH  BUT THEY CALLED HIM AMEN",
      "although it was actually WALLACH in the Italian variant which  of course  implies a tribute of sorts to Hollywood actor Eli!   While certainly not unwatchably bad  instances of clumsiness and ineptitude abound so that I was often cracking up into howls of laughter: a horrid number by a would-be irresistible French chanteuse; a totally irrelevant bar-room brawl; actors doing somersaults when being shot; an aged villager doing an impromptu dance routine; ineffective use (indeed abuse) of slow-motion; and  easily the most preposterous  seeing Gordon Mitchell and Lincoln Tate play two gunfighters (sporting the actors' own names!) hired by the villain to kill off the title character and then never having them appear in the rest of the film at all!!   Lead actor Robert Woods is just that even down to ineffectively whispering the Amens over the bodies of his victims. Supporting actress Simonella Vitelli (actually  the director's own daughter!) as the villain's broad is quite a looker but  unfortunately  she doesn't get to do much in the film  despite having a change of heart towards the end.

      "Hi  today i looked this film because of the medium (5 6) IMDb rating. I thought it would worth viewing. Also the comments here were quiet good but after start watching this movie i quick realize that this movie isn't anyway near a 5 6 ! Its just boring. You can describe the movie with some words also its just the standard horror movie story with all the standard horror movie scenes. I don't know why people still like those films or why they vote such films better then a 1-3 in IMDb. Just some examples   Bunch of people arriving from somewhere or going / driving to anywhere. They meet somehow on their journey strange people but hey maybe they are just nice so hang out with them. Then a very important scene for every horror movie Oh my cell phone isn't working oh oh mine too .. is that strange but we don't need them so enjoy our ride ... uhhhhhh our strange person is a strange psychopath better we all sit back and scream a while till he starts cutting parts from us or killing some of us. After a while the bunch of victims get a weapon or chance to escape ofcorse they never think about running away or even kill the psychopath if they got the chance they just talk about what to do until the psychopath got his weapon back with any of the handful of standard tricks they got in those films and all running back as usual ... screaming ... some more to kill ... oh and in the end it gets really exiting sometimes the bad guy wins sometimes some of the victim can escape wow great movies. ... OK if i never ever saw a movie of that kind i would say it is a movie which can be watched but if anyone ever saw any movie of its kind it should be just a boring waste of time because nearly everything in the movie you know before you even watched it because it every time runs like the standard horror movie shematic. .... mmm maybe there is a windows program out there?

      "I didn't want to write this movie off on the reviews and critics in the western world  I mean how wrong have they been about Asian cinema that has now become a staple diet of the Hollywood remake monster? Plus Jet L is pretty damn cool  and he's made some interesting movies in Asia. So with an open mind I was surprisingly averaged out by this movie.  There are good points. The story is very clever  using M-Theory as a base to bring forward the plot that there are multiple universes each with their own versions of worlds  and most likely you. Each time one of you is destroyed the rest share the energy and power amongst them. The idea that someone might try and purposely become the only version of themselves in all the Universes to find out if they become a God.  There's also Jet Li  and he's not a bad actor and pretty nimble as a martial artist  plus Jason Statham who is an all round good actor. As for the special effects  some of them are really cool  a mixing of bullet time  and slow motion with normal speed  very cool to watch in places.  The bad points? Well Statham's accent is appalling  and some of the effects aren't as comparable as others  so it's quite apparent that money was spent on some of the main shots and not on others that were probably deemed as too short on screen or they just plain ran out of budget.  A big sore point for me is the close cropped camera action that Hollywood has long favoured  something that Jackie Chan has often talked about. Filming fight scenes close up serves two purpose. It gives greater emphasis on a single punch or movement  making it look harder and more real than it really is  and it also hides what is going on around the camera lens. For example people holding a fake arm or the face of a stunt double  etc.  What Chan always said was that he tried to open out the camera and show the audience what was going on  let them see the people fighting properly rather than a close up of a face and a fist  cutting to someone falling into frame. Showing the whole picture is more effective  and it's more impressive.  So the close cropped shots were just more annoying than anything  you failed to see the impressiveness of Li's fighting skills  and you found it hard to see some of the action. Slow the cuts down and pan out the camera Hollywood Directors! The biggest problem was the story though  despite having such a strong base on which to build  they seemed to loose the sense of the plot and concentrate on the action scenes. There are some serious plot building and explanatory moments that are just totally overlooked and covered in the space of a few sentences  yet these could have formed some excellent and complex character development.  It just all held together too weakly  and not enough was made of the story. All in all  not a great movie and it's potential was badly spoiled.\n",

      "Revenge of the Zombies is a pretty weak and barely passable zombie effort.  **SPOILERS**  Traveling in the Bayou  Larry Adams  (Robert Lowery) and Scott Warrington  (Mauritz Hugo) are informed that a friend has deceased. Meeting with local Dr. Von Altermann  (John Carradine) he repeats the notion that they mysteriously died. While they are staying there  they realize that the help consists of zombies  reanimated dead people who are doing the bidding of their master. As the bodies pile up  he reveals that he has been making the creatures for use in various experiments and all try to stop him before it's too late.  The Good News: This here gets very little right. The opening is easily it's best  as it's got several great marks for it. From where it starts  with the creepy silhouettes walking in the dark all the way through to the revelations  this one works wonders for both it's mystery and great imagery. The big one is a really scene where the creature emerges from a coffin in a long  slow and creepy shot. These here are all done before the opening credits and is a fun sight. The scenes in the middle where the creature reawakens inside the coffin is pretty chilling and looks really great. The last big positive is the really fun ending. With the sort of ending that feels reminiscent of so many Universal attempts  this one fits in with that style. From the creepy reanimation to the real action involved near the swamp  this one is fun and really works with the others to give it's only real positives.  The Bad News: This one here only has a couple flaws  but they are major ones. The first one is the film's major boredom from inactivity. Almost nothing happens in here  mainly due to the tendency to do everything with talking rather than anything else. There's only intermittent scenes relegated to the zombies  yet there's nothing here that devotes any action to the film. This one simply doesn't have any action  and that's what hurts the film. It rarely generates a scenes that keeps the interest going  and at times this makes it feel a lot longer than it really is. The last flaw in the film are it's pathetic excuses for zombies. Those used to more modern fare will have a hard time getting any fear out of these creatures  and they really only serve several scenes. This here doesn't treat the zombies as threats  making them even less frightening. Little screen-time  nonthreatening nature and un-modern behavior from these zombies really destroys this one. These here are what really hurt the film.  The Final Verdict: With bad zombies and hardly anything worth watching  this one here is a curious effort. Those used to modern zombies will find little of interest in this one and come out the same as this one is  while only classic horror fans are advised to give it a shot.

Most of these films are exceptional and have withstood the passing of time. However  a lesser-known Roach product was the pairing of Thelma Todd and Zasu Pitts (later  Todd was paired with the equally untalented Patsy Kelly). Try as I might  I just can't stand these pictures--they just aren't funny. Plus  unlike Laurel and Hardy  there was not an ounce of chemistry between Todd and her two co-stars. Before you just think I am a crank  understand that I have seen and reviewed several hundred Roach films as well as many other early comedies  so I am well acquainted with the genre and within the genre  this team is among the worst. Part of the reason I think I am right about the team is that as a lower-tier team at Roach  they were given all the scripts no one else wanted. If Stan or Ollie hated a given plot idea  it was often given to Todd and Pitts/Kelly--and usually it showed.  In this film  however  the team is at their absolute lowest. It's hard to imagine a comedy with less laughs and a more contrived plot. The film begins with Zasu in the jury and Thelma as a defense lawyer. As for Zasu  she's a completely annoying moron. NOT the lovable type moron (like Stan Laurel or Lou Costello)  but just a totally annoying and grating person who is pushy and obnoxious. As for Thelma  as usual  she's the rather bland straight man and as such has little to do but react to Zasu's boorish behavior.  The plot involves Thelma defending a client who is accused of selling exploding diet pills. Considering that the pills are highly dangerous  when the attorney asks Zasu to try swallowing one it just seems dumb. And  while they were called pills  they were more like giant black blobs that were larger than golf balls. Swallowing them only seemed contrived and made no sense--even for a low-brow comedy. When they find she has swallowed the pill and it really is explosive  everyone panics and runs about like idiots until the film ends.  As I said  I am not a fan of this team. However  even for those who want to like the film  there isn't one legitimate laugh in the entire short! When I talked over this review with my wife (who also saw the movie with me)  she thought my score of 2 was overly generous!!\n",

      "Is it a poorly acted  cliche-ridden pile of trash? Of course. Anyone who doesn't realize that when they pick up the box in the video store probably doesn't have any right judging movies in the first place. Thus  I will now rate the aspects of the film that we actually care about on a scale of 1 to 10:  Violence and gore: 4 -- For this genre  there are very few deaths  and the gore is almost non-existent. Anyone looking for a little blood should probably look elsewhere. The only redeeming quality is the fact that kids are doing these awful things  which raises the bar a little.  Suspense: 1 -- Okay  I feel bad for anyone who gets scared by this trio of dorky looking kids.  Nudity/sex: 7 -- Lots of boobage from three different women  one of whom is the MTV vj Julie Brown. There are two sex scenes  but little is shown in them.  Unintentional humor -- 4 -- There are a few good laughs with the kids trying to act scary  but all in all  it's just bad  not funny bad.  Overall -- 4 -- It's not unwatchable. There are a few fun moments  and enough nudity to keep your attention for the entire movie. However  only watch this movie if you're a big fan of the 80's slasher flicks. This definitely falls on the lower end of the scale  but it's not all the way at the bottom. The real downside is the disappointing ending. It almost ruined the movie for me.\n",

      " The movie begins with some cavemen hunting an antelope-thing. Now  antelopes must have evolved a lot from those pre-historic times because they actually attack and kill people here. After that  it's time to meet the rest of the tribe: more bearded men  some fashion-models  and even a couple of very old  grey-haired grannies and grandpas. These old geezers obviously never heard about cave people not surpassing the age of 30; they refused to bow to the will of both logic and pre-historical records  so they remain alive. One of the cavemen isn't bearded; he is clean-shaven. Not quite as clean-shaven as Tarzan  The Lord of the Humanoid Clean-Shaven Ones Roaming the Jungle Since Childhood And Without a Razor  but thereabouts.  What follows is the obligatory earthquake/molten-lava destruction sequence which causes a lot of our not-so-hairy friends to meet their doom. It is interesting to note that before the earthquake the fashion-models showed their breasts more. After it  they must have gotten shy or something  because they covered their chests for a while (maybe they were covered by ash so I mistakenly thought they were covered). More action follows in the form of two fashion-models wrestling in the sand; the next-best thing to female mud-wrestling  I suppose. After a good deal of the desert has been crossed  our black-haired tribe meets - how else could it be - a blond tribe. Yawn.  More spellbinding stuff follows. There is that redhead fashion-model who is bothered by seeing a cave-teen kill a hedge-hog-thing. There is also the scene of a woman dying at birth: those cave-fashion-models are so frail. Eventually we get to meet an even darker -haired and -skinned tribe  i.e. an evil tribe. One of them becomes a WWF champion after he actually beats(!) a huge bear-thing in a wrestling bout. 1 2 3... and it's done: the bear is the loser. We also witness a jealous caveman miraculously recover from two major injuries: first he gets stabbed with a big spear into the thigh  yet he walks away from that as if it were but a scratch. Then he gets thrown off a cliff - onto a big rock - by the blond goodie-two-shoes caveman  yet he walks away from it as if he were thrown onto a giant sofa. It's unclear in the end whether he dies from falling off an even higher cliff or from that voodoo doll being crushed. Oh yes  voodoo was used in pre-historic times by white tribes that live in the desert and whose females were fashion-models. It's always important to learn from movies.  The message of the movie is as insightful as it is educational: cave people liked to fight for local power and they loved their fashion-models  too. As if any self-respecting caveman would fight to be leader of such a sorry bunch.\n",

      "Hitting the ground running  the film begins with THREE murders in a row. No plot  no characters  no motivation; the second murder happens off screen  and that victim's severed head is actually used to quite efficiently bludgeon the third victim to death! This is a high point. But the Lewises are obviously smart enough to lead with strength; soon they're covering up botched dialogue scenes with detective voice-over and shooting endless snappy repartee in ugly wide shot. By now this Betacam production's horror atmosphere is rapidly giving way to an insurance infomercial vibe  with the monumental (and rather endearing) plainness of the leads skewing things further in that direction. Shlub cop investigates  meat cleaver guy slaughters  repeat  climaxing early with a memorable severed-finger-in-the-salad gag. Only  how the hell did the fingers get in the salad? And wasn't the Blood Cult's purpose to collect the appendages they severed? When the GORE stops making sense  you know you're in trouble. And without spoiling the big  nonsensical twist ending  just take my word for it: the fascinating incompetence of the first scenes gives way to a deep cathode-tube-smashing impulse. The basic reaction is to try to put it behind you and get on with your life.\n",

      "Fool for Love is one of the several now forgotten films Robert Altman directed throughout the 1980s. This one  a screen adaptation of a Sam Shepard play that features Shepard in the lead role  just simply isn't very good. Altman made many not-very-good films over the course of his fascinating career  and many times the fault was his. But here I think the fault lies with Shepard for writing such a flimsy play. Altman's direction is assured  the performances are o.k. given what the actors have to work with  but this inconsequential screenplay goes nowhere  and takes its time getting there.  Shepard is Eddie  a stuntman who has a love/hate relationship with May (Kim Basinger). The two fight endlessly over the course of an evening spent in some dusty motel in the middle of nowhere  while a mysterious man (Harry Dean Stanton) who may be either a figurative or literal father to both Eddie and May quietly observes. Randy Quaid rounds out the four-person cast as a gentleman caller.  The only dramatic hook in the entire plot is the suggestion that Eddie's and May's relationship is incestuous. However  this hook feels more like a gimmick than anything. The screenplay doesn't explore their relationship in any detail  and it doesn't use their relationship to explore any more universal themes. Shepard and Basigner create eccentric  mannered characters who grow irritating within the first five minutes; Stanton and Quaid have little to do but provide reaction shots.   The last half hour or so of the film is especially bad  when Eddie's and May's back stories begin to play out in flashback over monotone  somnolent voice over.  Chalk this up to another of Altman's experiments gone awry.  Grade: C-\n",

And the kids are all thin  white  and gorgeous  with the exceptional token minority or fat kid to play the weird outcast. And there aren't any reasonable rules  like how they have co-habitation  nuclear weapons in their dorms  coffee stands  a sushi bar  and a complimentary laptop per student.  Here's the story: A girl  Zoey Brooks  attends PCA  a formerly all-boys school. Absolutely perfect in every possible way  she is smart  pretty  thin  athletic  creative  and everything a perfectionist wants to be. Almost all the boys in school want her  and every girl wants to be her friend. She's the one everyone comes to for advice  the one who saves the day with a simplistic plan  and is just wonderful. Too bad none of this makes her likable.  Are we supposed to believe that if we don't even come close to Zoey's perfection  we're bad people? In the show  nothing's her fault  and if anyone contradicts her  they're portrayed as the bad guy(Logan). He may be a jerk  but at least he has some kind of brain that thinks for himself instead of simply agreeing with the princess every time.  Her loyal group of blind followers are: Chase  the average dumb ass that has a secret crush on her  Michael  the token black guy (and the only decent actor on the set)  Lola  a wannabe actress and anorexic  snobby airhead  Quinn  the smart but clueless girl when it comes to teen stuff  and Logan  the rich jerk who has a soft side. Yeah  this show basically spews out stereotypes.  What ticks me off  though  is that they all try to pretend they're normal kids. They complain that Logan gets too much money while they have to work themselves  even though they already go to a too-good-to-be-true boarding school and have relatively nice things that many teenagers can't afford. They drink coffee and eat sushi on a regular basis  hardly have homework  and suntan almost every day. Wow  they have it hard! Any other problems? I'm too good-looking  rich  and stress-free! I guess Zoey 101 (what's the 101 for  anyway?) is Nick's attempt at trying to portray teens realistically.

      "This is a title in search of a movie. It's a pitch that sounded lucrative to some studio executive and the rest be damned. When this film was made there were still two things that CGI did not do at all well: people  and fur. Furry people were thus not destined to look good when rendered by computer. This is the only example I can think of where effects for a well-funded sequel took a giant leap back landing well behind those of the original movie. For the record  the design of the werewolves doesn't help a bit. The film-makers apparently couldn't decide between quadruped and biped  tried to do both  and wound up with a creature that looks equally awkward either way. The transformations are anatomically nonsensical and the end result with a relatively high forehead and short snout looks like a cross between Ron Perlman and a hyena. But back to the crass part. This is a movie which exists PURELY to cash in on its forebear. I am not a fan of Landis' original film but boy  does it look good in light of this. If you thought some of Landis' humor was forced try some of the excruciating attempts here. The bubble gum scene  the corpse humor  the dog that...you know  you'll just have to watch that bit yourselves.

Autobiographical feature by director Duncan Roy (JACKSON: MY LIFE...

Unfortunately  Roy's screenplay says very little we didn't already know about the excesses of the idle rich  and the narrative is only briefly ignited by Leitch's relationship with a handsome but self-destructive rent boy (Peter Youngblood Hills) who turns out to be no less hypocritical than the very people he seeks to emulate.

A long  pointless film  too personal for wide appeal  and hampered throughout by a cinematic process which fails to reconcile the story at hand.

These films are often funny  and get rated 2-4 based sheerly on entertainment value - not as a representation of their exemplary film artistry. This film fits this model perfectly. It is a Mexican monster movie  riddled with voice-over narrative and extremely weak not-so-special effects. The makeup is not that bad  and the acting is sometimes quite entertaining  but this film is almost as silly as Aliens vs Predator and the script isn't half as slick (Aliens vs Predator might get a 1 from me  but I want to see it again before I commit).  The plot is ridiculous  but deliciously convoluted. If you've read this far  you must really want to know... A group of remarkably unscientific scientists comprise the main characters.

      "(Some Spoilers) Dull as dishwater slasher flick that has this deranged homeless man Harry  Darwyn Swalve  out murdering real-estate agent all over the city of L.A because of the high prices that they charge for their proprieties. Looking like an extra from a Clint Eastwood Spaghetti Western Harry who's been living in abandoned houses eating dog food get's very upset where his quite lifestyle as a squatter is interrupted. This happens when a number of real-estate agents invaded his space in an attempt to sell the houses  that he's staying at to their potential clients.  Joseph Bottome stars in this bottom-of-the-barrel horror movie as radio talk-show host Dr. David Kelly the handsome and popular host psychologist of the KDRX survival line. DR. Kelly is being sued by the family of one of his callers Tracy  who ended up blowing her brains out while on the air with the doc who couldn't do anything to help her survive her ordeal of taking to him.  The real-estate killer gets to talk with Dr. Kelly on the air about his adventures and the police try to get the doc to get his phone number and address  by keeping him on the line  but he refuses to in order not to hurt his rating by having potential callers not call in in fear of being monitored by the LADP.   Kelly also is having a hot and heavy affair with a real-estate manager and agent the busty Lisa Grant  Adrienne Barbeau  who's office of sellers are Harry's main victims in he movie. Harry also gets to murder Lisa's main competition in the housing business the chubby and outrageous Barney Resnick  Barry Hope  who threatened to put Lisa out of business by any means possible even if he has to kill her.   Getting Berney alone and with his pants down Harry slices his head off while he's being entertained by one of his clients  a hooker  whom he leaves dead and hanging together with the headless Barney. The movie ends with the deranged Harry taking Lisa hostage and having Dr. Kelly try to come to her rescue only to have Det. Shapiro (Robert Miano)  looking like e hasn't slept in a week  pop out of nowhere and blow Harry's brains out. Harry quickly come back to life minus the gay matter between his ears and gets himself killed for the second time in the movie by being thrown from a balcony and landing on the ground as a dozen members of the LAPD  M16 cocked and ready  come on the scene.  Nothing in the movie Opean House worked with the tension laughable to almost non-existent. Even the hot sex scenes between Dr. Kelly and Lisa didn't save the movie since there were far too few only two  of them and and sexy Adrienne Barbeau was a bit too underexposed  with not enough light and too much clothes on  in all of them.  Harry the killer in the movie was also a bit to comical to be taken seriously in trying to make a point  to Dr. Kelly on the phone and in person  about the high rents and real-estate prices in the country and how people like himself find it almost impossible to find a decent place to live in. You can sympathize with Harry's concern about the high cost of living but be very critical of him in how he crazily went on in correcting it.\n",

      "I was disappointed with the sequel to the Swan Princess. I can see what they were trying to do with the story  show how married life was going for Odette and Derek but the story wasn't interesting enough to hold my attention and it seemed to cover the same bases as the original.  It isn't funny. The only bit I found humorous was when Jean-Bob was turned into a prince and then back into a frog and no-one saw it happen and he was trying to convince them that it really did.  The villain is rubbish and the animation isn't as impressive as the first film.  The Queen is a very irritating character and instead of cheering with Derek to rescue his mother  you're hoping that the villain puts a spell on her voice box to stop her talking.  It is a shame because I really liked the first movie but it didn't live up to my expectations.\n",

      "Kokoda was inspired by events on the Kokoda track during WW2 when Australian militia slowed and ultimately stopped a push by 10 000 Japanese soldiers to move overland and capture Port Moresby. What they really mean is that the movie is set in this time period but is fiction and everything that happens is just a jumble of standard scenes from other war films. The first hour is just one cliché after another. Some of the scenes are simply there to be able to draw us into a feeling that this conflict was horrific beyond compare  when there appears to be little evidence of this. Both sides fought hard to control the track and no mercy was shown by either side. Both sides suffered from logistic shortages and the terrain was a great leveler in this conflict. As the Japanese got closer to Port Moresby their supply line grew and this ultimately led to their downfall. On the other hand as the Australians retreated closer to Port Moresby their supply line decreased. Some of the scenes appear to be straight out of the handbook on standard scenes to include in any war film. The film was misguided and highlighted the youth of the production team. At a time when Australia could have done with a great film about one of Australia's best moments the film Kokoda is a shallow disappointment.\n",

      "I am ashamed of myself that I actually went to the theatre to watch this movie when it was first released. While I suppose its thinly veiled depiction of the Aristotle Onassis and Jackie Kennedy story is well enough done  it's a movie that should never have been made in the first place; hence  my low rating.  The film chronicles the tale of a wealthy Greek business shark called Theo Tomasis  who woos and wins the lovely young widow  Liz Cassidy  of a slain American President. Sound familiar? Yes  everything except the names.  The cast is not to be faulted. Anthony Quinn plays the Greek tycoon to perfection  and at least it's some consolation  having just read that Ari himself requested Quinn for the role. Jacqueline Bisset is of course beautiful and sophisticated in the part of (for all intents and purposes) Jackie  and James Franciscus has the all American good looks of the President.  I haven't seen this movie since it came out  nor do I wish to see it again. I seem to recall a fair bit of bad language and some general crudeness. Otherwise  I suppose it's a sensational and supposedly intimate glimpse into the jet setting lives of the rich and famous  frolicking aboard their yachts  beaches  pools etc. Yes  the scenery of the Greek islands is spectacular  the best part of the movie.  Of its type  it's okay  I suppose. There are no end of TV movies about the Kennedys  which I confess to occasionally tuning in to  and not to my credit. This is basically just another. Far better to allow Aristotle and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis to rest in peace.\n",

      "Ben Affleck  about to be married  is shaken up by a plane accident and gets involved with one of the other passengers (Sandra Bullock  forcing herself to act insane). Who is to blame for this inept  ugly morass? It is so badly edited  when I looked in the credits it wasn't to read the editor's name--it was to see if the person actually took the credit! Rife with clichés  contrivances  and Sandra Bullock in raccoon eye-makeup  the movie doesn't even concern itself with creating chemistry between the two main characters. Laughs are non-existent: the scene in the gay bar with Affleck might have gotten a big laugh if it weren't so stupid (the bar patrons--a big rowdy bunch of them!--shout for Affleck to strip and start digging out their cash). It's not supposed to have any significance other than getting Ben to loosen up a little  but the direction of the whole scene is wrong-headed  and the outcome is unseen because the idiot editor cuts away...or was that all the film he had? It's a small moment but it's typical of this film  an amateurish piece of pop-goods that wants to be an edgy modern comedy but doesn't have any guts. It is tailor-made for the bottom shelf at your video store. * from ****\n",

      "The creative team behind Evan Almighty really should have been able to make a better film. Starring one of America's favourite funnymen and helmed by Ace Ventura Pet Detective director Tom Shadyac one expects a higher laugh count than the picture provides. Hell even Steve Oedekerk who wrote and directed last years atrocious Barnyard  and attains a writing credit here has done better work. The fact of the matter is that Evan Almighty isn't the worst picture of the Summer season but it might well be the most disappointing. The title and creative team behind the picture suggest this is a sequel of sorts to 2003's Bruce Almighty. That picture had Jim Carrey in the lead  and whilst both Steve Carell and Carrey are both funny guys it's the latter who's better suited to this sort of material. I've heard that Carrey was offered this sequel before anyone else  but the actor declined staing he saw no other places for his character to venture. Thus Shadyac moved over to Carell  who ever since an amusing bit part in the 2003 original has been gunning for stardom. After sleeper hits The 40 Year Old Virgin and Little Miss Sunshine the man has become big business  and so it's him rather than rubber faced Jim who leads this production into theatres. The story see's Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) having been elected as a Congressman and thus he and his troop move house and state so Evan can find success with his job. His wife (Lauren Graham) and three kids have doubts but overall show a supportive side towards Evan  who himself looks at the future with optimistic eyes. However things start to go belly up fairly fast  God (Morgan Freeman) appears to Evan stating a flood is coming and that the politician must build an Ark. Initially ignoring the encounter  Evan is quickly granted some robes a beard that refuses to stay shaved and animals are beginning to appear two by two. Evan then begins to put the boat into construction but the neighbourhood aren't happy and neither is a fellow Politician (John Goodman). Anyone expecting the wacky laughs of some of Tom Shadyac's other films will probably be left completely cold by this movie. Ace Ventura  Liar Liar and hell even Bruce Almighty where largely very funny pictures  but all of those ;projects have one thing in commen and thats Jim Carrey's presence. Shadyac hasn't made a worthwhile film without Carrey at the helm  he's worked with Robin Williams  Eddie Murphy and now Steve Carell  but still only Carrey seems to meld successfully with Shadyac. Carell after the disappointing Box-Office and critical mauling won't be desperate to work with the director again  and with Carrey now doing more serious projects Shadyac had better find a new comic muse fast. Carell himself is fairly dull here  whoever felt that his bit part in the first movie (Despite being quite amusing) deserved a full length feature should be taken out back and shot. I expect after Bruce Almighty's Box-Office draw it was Universal studios themselves  but you know when a quality comedian can't do anything with a character then the scren persona is a dud  and thats exactly the case with Evan Almighty. Lauren Graham isn't any great shakes as Evan's wife nor do any of the children strike the right note. Freeman lets it all hang loose as God in another amusing and chilled performance but he appears to sporadically to carry the piece. Indeed the most consistent source of laughter is Evan's Secretary (Wanda Sykes) and creep co-worker (Jonah Hill)  both made me laugh twice as much as any other character in the project. Oedekerk's writing has been worse (Barnyard) but also better (Ace Ventura When Nature Calls) than his work on this production. His script does have genuinely funny moments but it's also full of cloying family moments and the humour is never weird or indeed offensive enough. The film takes tame and easy swipes at religion when it ought to rip the concept to shreds  indeed the opening church sequence in The Simpsons Movie shakes religion harder than Evan Almighty's whole 95 minute run. With a bit more daring and heart this could have been a far better picture. I don't doubt that the core family audience will be mildly entertained by this film  but if they'll be satisfied is a completely different question. There's a line between being watchable and being worthwhile  a line that Evan Almighty is always on the wrong side off. Maybe when you're feeling bored and the films on cable you can afford to watch  but I can think of plenty better ways to spend my time and indeed more importantly my money than tuning into this mediocre comedy.\n",

      "I just finished reading Forsyth's novel 'Icon'. I thought it was one of the most in depth  detailed  and page-turning books I ever read  definitely in my top 10. I acquired a DVD version of the book starring Mr. Swayze. OK  let me first point out that to fit a decent adaptation of the novel into 2.5 hours film time would of been impossible  so I understand the teams reason to sway from the book version and differ. However  when I say differ what I really should say is take the characters from the book  add a few  leave a few out  take away the book's plot  add a modern new plot  add Frederick Forsyth's name in there somewhere. Im not saying this was a bad picture  far from it  some of the effects were top notch and the acting wasn't half bad. The story sucked and didn't rely on logic or reality. Forsyth's novel was so good and real and altered the facts of reality instead of exaggerating them.. This could of been so much more if it had taken its time and been made into say a 10 part series. If you haven't read the book then expect a decent TV movie with a good acting cast  if you have read the book then try and forget it when watching this.\n",

      "If Halloween 5 was a cruel joke to the fans of the series  than Halloween 6 is a like a vicious insult. The storyline has gone to the dogs everyone. Michael is used as a helpless pawn in this film and he isn't at all scary. He reminds me of an over-weight alcoholic man than the boogeyman that struck fear in our hearts back in the original. There are almost no redeemable qualities about this feature and i'm so glad H20 came out because it would be an insult to fans to have this be fresh on our minds.  Halloween 6 had about 2 aspects that I liked. Having an adult Tommy Doyle in the film was a nice touch and it linked it to the original. Donald Pleasance is here(in his last performance...what a bad film to end an otherwise nice career on). When he's on screen he makes you remember the good old days when Halloween was actually scary.  That's about it my friends. The stalk sequences are unoriginal. One of them being a blatant rip-off of the Laurie/Michael chase in the original. The other characters are terribly under-written and just aren't likable. The music  on of Halloween's highlights even when the film is bad  is tortured in this film. we get a silly rock version of the stalk/chase theme. What were they thinking when they made this film.  *SPOILER*  Their biggest mistake was killin off the character of Jamie(Now played by another actress who isn't worth mentioning)We watched this character escape death in two films. We rooted for her and when she is killed in this film you cant help but feel sorry for her and realize that the filmmakers don't care when good characters are established in a film.  *END SPOILER*  The less said about thi embarrassment the better. I wish it didn't exist. I suggest skipping this film  and even 5  and just going straight to H20 because if you watch this you may not want to see another Halloween film again.\n",

      "The mission to see the movie The Cave was a dream of a friend of mine after witnessing the highly dramatic trailer  full of flashes of a creature lurking in a cave  some young cave divers  and not much else. It's too bad that the movie didn't change much more than the trailer did.  The immediate allure of a movie like this is the creature. What's he going to look like? Why does he live in a cave? How is this one supposed to be different from the other creatures we've been shown in movies like Alien and Predator and the Relic? The cave demons do not look far from the skeletal creature in Alien: Resurrection and even has the sight of Predator. Shame that's a total ripoff...  Well  let's look at the plot: very confusing and jumps to more and more totally improbable twists as a team of cave divers is sent to find a cave and its dwellers in the Carpathian Mountains. The casting was very much clear that we want young  hip  tough chicks  chiseled guys  and the girls who have brains also have to be hot. We also have to have one of every racial background in case the audience thinks that the film-makers are biased to a certain viewpoint. Totally been done  and I'm totally tired of it.  The other main problem was the ending  as if to say there might be a sequel. Plase shoot me if there is one. The tagged on ending made me wretch.  I gave this movie 3/10 stars. The points that it did get were more or less appreciation points towards the creature-builders for their high-quality job spent on the costuming and design for the monsters who dwell within  even when they looked totally ripped off. And there's an interesting (yet labored) documentary on the DVD on underwater cave diving. Go check it out only if you love new creations of monsters and creatures  but be warned that you've probably seen this movie before  and it was better the first time.\n",

Everyone knows the story...which wasn't that bad for a KIDS movie. Yes  it is a KIDS movie...and therefore should be treated as such. Jamie Kennedy is not very good in his role. His attempts to act crazy are not very good and overall acting is poor.  Everyone else is not too bad.  Basically  my 2 and 5 year old watched the whole thing without complaining.

      "I just realized why the colors and sets in Sakuran were so flashy and gaudy  and just painful to look at. The story is about a high-class prostitute known as an oiran in Japanese. Their kimono were always flashier and gaudier than other kimono so that the oiran would stand out. But the director  Mika Ninagawa  had to make sure that the director stood out even more than the main character  or even the story.   What Anna Tsuchiya did in the movie just gave me the creeps. You couldn't call it acting. It was nothing more than catering to her flipped-out  high-school-girl fan base. Hey Anna  good luck on that one as you get older. Yeah  right  an oiran as a crude and vulgar  prone- to-violence  biker chick. Didn't we already see you portray this character in a more appropriate movie?  The story was painfully boring and predictable. What is the story of Sakuran? An obnoxious little bitch ever remains true to her self which is just that: an obnoxious bitch. She finds that  inexplicably  men are attracted to her and that she has an unexplained ability to manipulate men and becomes a successful  high-class prostitute even though she talks and behaves like she's a member of a female biker gang. This so-called seductive ability of hers is talked about but we never see it in action  probably due to the ineptitude of the main  pretend-phony-biker chick  I mean actress.   The main character of the movie makes a wealthy and powerful man angry at her because she keeps him waiting while she services a much more lowly customer. Not very oiran-like  is it? How could such a woman ever become an oiran? Oh  because the previous oiran got herself killed and the house needed a whore that could demand a high price. Who would pay a high price for a slut so cheap? Rumors get around. How could there be no repercussions for what she did to the powerful guy? Because the screenwriters are dolts. They just made up a bunch of crap.  Then an even more wealthy and powerful guy falls for her (why?) and she throws him over for a penniless guy who is generally cold and distant toward her but respects who she really is (which doesn't make sense. How can anyone respect someone so worthless?).  Speaking of crap  it's like the director squatted down and took a huge  psychedelic-colored dump on the aesthetics  culture  and society of the Edo Period. What of such things as sabi  mono no aware  wabi  subtlety  elegance  a rigidly hierarchical society? All shat upon by a director who comes off as a senseless  nouveau-riche parvenu. The amazing thing is that so many other Japanese  in watching this movie  squatted down around the director and took steaming spoonfuls of this blazing-colored stinking crap and exclaimed how tasty it was.  Argentinean tango music with violin and bandoneon as backdrop for the Edo Period when Japan was totally isolated from the international world (except for the 3.7 acres of Dejima)? Why not just have Anna  the bad-ass-biker oiran  answer her cell phone and the rich and powerful daimyo character drive off in a hissy fit in his red Ferrari? The music we had to listen to was jarring and anachronistic (the same as the art design).   Near the ending  I liked that there were only two or three tiny flowers on the shrine cherry tree. But  earlier  the second she said she would leave the quarters when it bloomed  we all knew exactly what would happen. How boring  to telegraph the ending so clearly. But what's the point of the old tree blooming? That rich and powerful guy already made the pleasure quarters bloom in cherry blossoms like the mountains of Yoshino in spring. That didn't impress her at all? No  of course not. I already know that about whores. The guys that treat them nicely get kicked in the balls. Maybe it bugs the whores to have people idealize them when they themselves know the truth of who they are: just cheap and worthless.  Considering the director's obsession with goldfish  the second to last scene should have been of a goldfish bowl on a verandah accidentally knocked over. Two fish tumble into a stream which carries them off to escape beyond the walls of the pleasure quarters  belying how goldfish are stuck in their bowl and can't survive outside (just like the denizen's relationship with the pleasure quarters). Otherwise the talk of the fate of goldfish has no meaning.  In the final scene the cherry trees were full in bloom  but the brevity of the blooms is one thing special about cherry blossoms. I couldn't help thinking that soon enough dusk would wipe away all the soft pink color and warmth from the scene. The sky would go quickly from hints of shadow  into an ever- deepening gloom  and night would fall. It would become cold  very cold. And dark. That really wasn't a happy ending  was it? Romantic love (in the Edo Period?) could survive in the face of terrible poverty and being ostracized for about as long as those cherry trees bloomed. Maybe a few days  unless it rained sooner. But the unconsummated romantic love we see here? It's existence in this period is incomprehensible.  Anna Tsuchiya walking in the shoes of an oiran? She couldn't do it. Literally. Check out the scene of her promenade where she seems to have the correct footwear on but she has to hold on to some guy's shoulder to keep from tumbling on her ass.  I was going to give this movie two stars for the art direction but then I realized what that was all about: sick dominance on the part of the director. Those colors and sets are just the way the director has of screaming  I'm the most important one here! Me! It's all about me!!!!\n",

      "Usually  I start my reviews with an explanation of how and why I watched the film I'm reviewing. With this  I simply cannot explain. I needed to be awake early for work the next day so the last thing I wanted to do was watch a film that I didn't know anything about. But something kept me glued to my comfy futon as I watched this Heather Graham vehicle. Oh  that's right. Boredom.  Graham plays Joline  a bohemian nut-case who seems more obsessed with her marriage vows than the guy she married (played by Luke Wilson). When her hubby decides to set off in search of better things (work  women and scripts  presumably)  Joline begins a fanatical quest to find her husband and free him from his spiritual wheelchair. It sounds like I'm making this up but sadly  I'm not. In reality  this is little more than an acting exercise for Graham as she gamely gives this Phoebe-from-Friends role a work-out. Oh and Goran ER Visnjic is in there as well  for some reason.  The TV schedules had this down as a comedy but I failed to find a single laugh anywhere. It struck me that this was a personal journey for Lisa Krueger (the director and writer)  in the same mould as Girl  Interrupted but even that had more laughs than this. Graham's character is simply too self-centred for the audience to care about and I felt sorry for the hen-pecked husband as he bravely fought for his freedom from his clearly mental wife. Very little of this film made sense as characters simply appeared in the story as though they were standing around  waiting for Graham to turn up like the extras in The Truman Show. In fact  the only positive note I can produce from my scribblings was Heather Graham - nice baps. And that wasn't because I was too tired to enjoy the film.  In truth  it's very difficult to think of anybody to recommend this film to. Graham purists (a VERY small number of overall movie-goers  I think you'll agree) will have to be committed to watch this dross and possibly hippy students who collect American Indian dream-catchers will take something from this. I was amazed that the average rating (at time of writing) was 5.0 - that would make this film as good as Die Another Day and Gothika in my book and that simply ain't right. Committed is a quirky oddball mess of a movie that neither entertains or enlightens. It's complicated  pointless and simply too boring for my tastes and probably yours too. Don't even think about watching this.\n",

      "I have just finished watching this movie  and for me.... it takes ages to finish because it is so boring.....and the storyline is extremely bad.  now... where should i start....O.... the movie is called sinking of japan ....yeah yeah... it does show that japan is actually sinking but the action part is very bad. Compare to the movie the day after tomorrow i would have rate it at least 8/10.  The sinking of Japan does not show much about the disaster that actually happening right in front of our eyes. there isn't much excitement at all...boring... all i can say...  one more point... i would recommend this movie to have a better title... maybe something like the romance of sinking of japan because this movie does have lots of talkings (waste of time... talk nonsense) & the love story is extremely boring & have been dragging too long...honestly.. i almost get frustrated.  Overall... this movie does not show enough details of the disasters e.g. many people running like hell to avoid death..love story part was extremely not touching enough for me.  but hey... there is one thing we should appreciate about this movie though.... & its has got good songs!\n",

      "Firstly  this movie works in the fact that it is disturbing. I really did not like seeing all these scenes where people get cut up alive  etc. The weirdly erotic introduction gives one a sense of necrophiliactic wonder. It is somewhat... distastefull to me personally. But the movie really works in that respect  and it is suppposed to be scary  so I give it credit for that. Yup  a few points there for those scalpels and....well  damned disturbing idea of getting disected alive.  But what this movie lacks is an interesting plot  characterization  or real surprises. The whole teen-flick horror genre usually goes in a very simple  predictable way. Lots of 'tense' moments  creepy guys who are insane  and the big question of all: is the boyfriend the murderer? This movie fits into the category of Scream and countless others which have spawned over the 90s. Well  I won't spoil it for you  but it's not exactly interesting who is the killer. We find out who it is half way through... and from there on  the movie drudges on  trying to fill in some time... rather boringly to say the least. I was looking at the clock a bit on this movie.  The lead actress is great  as usual  but the carboard acting box she is placed into makes one groan in pain... the college girl who is a detective who everyone thinks is insane  but she is the one who really knows whats going on. And the cops? Ahhh  they just laugh and eat donuts. Very predictable  flat  disturbing at times  and most of all  boring and dull... It's like an American film company took a flight to Germany to shoot a movie to make it foreign..... hmmm..... or did they?  \n",

      "A lack of character development proves fatal for this movie. Valeria Golino's character Grazia starts out looking like a bipolar personality but quickly degenerates into a caricature and seems unreal. The other characters are thin  probably the writer's fault not the actors'. The only exception is Filippo Pucillo as the younger son Filippo: his energy and bravado are funny and convincing.  I suppose the children's petty cruelty is supposed to contribute to an atmosphere of bleakness and emphasize the pervasive primal spirits in the town  but for me  the gratuitous cruelty is redundant and contributes to the overall boredom of the film. Some scenes were amusing but not necessarily intended that way  for example  when the mistreated dogs turn out to be fat and healthy and look like they are ready to show. The pretty cast and setting make for an appealing trailer but cannot carry the whole movie.\n",

      "1980 was certainly a year for bad backwoods slasher movies. Friday The 13th and The Burning may have been the best ones but there were like always a couple of stinkers not far behind like Don't Go Into The Woods Alone and this one. But in all fairness The Prey is nowhere near as bad as Don't Go Into The Woods but it's still not great either. One thing is that it's just boring and acting isn't very good but much better than DGITW and this movie actually has some attractive looking females to look at  all three of the female leads were stunning. One thing what is up with all that pointless wildlife footage it just seemed pointless and it looked as the director used that to just used that to fill up some time space.  So  what was there to like about this movie? Well  there were a few laugh out loud cheese moments- I couldn't contain a fit of giggles when the final girl did a bizarre type of backwards moon-walk to get away from the kille and there were a few good kill scenes- my favourites being the girl suffocated to death with the sleeping bag; and the phoney looking.  All in all The Prey is dumb  boring and the killer I didn't find scary at all  this movie could have been a whole lot better.\n",

This guy was supposed to be some sort of heartthrob? Quasimodo hubba hubba? Well  whatever.  Katherine Heigl's a great actress  whose career over the last several years has displayed a lot of her potential as both a comedic and dramatic actress  but this movie definitely didn't do anything to offer her a break-out role. Her vapid character lacks any trace of personality or self-esteem  spending her entire vacation crushing on a cute boy that she thinks is the greatest guy in then world (basically because he's a cute boy)  yet she can't be honest with him for two seconds. Ladies  let me tell you something; if a guy's really into you  he's not going to stomp off in a huff because you tried to pass your dad off as your boyfriend. He may be a little confused about why you'd do something so silly  contrived  and um...incestuous  but in the end it's just going to be something you'll laugh together about.  The plot and dialogue hits every clche' right on cue. No originality and no wit...but it's rilly  rilly SWEET and Ben's rilly  rilly cute so viewers who think Titanic is the greatest movie ever made will of course say this movie is great because they won't notice that it doesn't have a brain in its head.

Bad acting  confusing script and direction. Annoying characters I wanted to kill. The whole thing was probably made in one week. I've seen episodes of CHARMED that were more complex and convincing than this cheapie.  It has the look and feel of an orphaned episode of a badly conceived TV series no one has ever seen.

      "2/3 of this movie is recycled footage of the previous movies  a fact that's sadly obvious even to someone like myself who hasn't seen the original movies. And somehow it feels like a rip-off even though I haven't seen the stuff before. It's like that episode of every TV show where the characters sit around a photo album or something and you just see recycled footage of other episodes. I've seen some producers do extended montages of recycled footage  but never anything beyond 5 minutes or so. This movie is mostly stuff that had already been seen by audiences  so you could mount a case that it's one of the biggest rip-offs ever foisted on the motion picture public.  I got to see it in the theater  in a 16mm print  which is good enough I suppose considering how rare this kind of material must be on film these days. I give the movie some credit for semi-convincing Gothic atmosphere and for unintentional humor  but that's about it. The Aztec mummy monster looks good  even has some mobility in his face which is better than most movie monsters of the period. But the robot is pitiful  although it's interesting that they made the human face totally visible. It's a robot human or something of the sort as they somewhat explain in the movie. I think that's considered an android. So technically in hard sci-fi terms this movie should be called Android vs. the Aztec Mummy  but I doubt anyone was too worried about technicalities here anymore than they were worried about quality. In fact the movie is so sloppily put together that it makes television look good. Even the dubbing from Mexican into English is lazy and weak -- for example at one point the hero says I might as well begin at the beginning.... what the heck kind of translation is that? Couldn't they at least have him say start at the beginning so that it doesn't sound repetitive? A high school newspaper editor could have fixed the screenplay of this movie. It's the epitome of utilitarian film-making  just absolutely nothing is in this movie that doesn't need to be there for the basic commercial purpose of the film. They put no more effort into making it than they had to  and considering the extensive recycled footage I would doubt that they actually spent more than a week making this movie.  I will now cease posting about it on the principle that I don't want to expend more energy in the process of commenting than the creators of the movie actually expended while making it.\n",

      "This TVM seems to have polarised opinions amongst the commentators on this page so perhaps I can settle everything by saying this is a very stupid not very well made television movie . How bad is it ? It's a teleplay that can't even decide what its name is because while everyone in America calls it LINDA it's known in Britain as LUST FOR MURDER and it's usually a bad sign when a movie has to change its name . And can I also point out that it's not a tongue in cheek spoof as somebody else claimed   I will be honest and say the plot is rather sound . Linda and Paul Cowley meet another couple called the Jeffries who they get on very well with . They get on so well that they go on holiday together ( Make up your own mind if there's some wife swapping going on ) and Paul sees his wife kill the Jeffries . After that the plot takes a shock twist   Writing the above paragraph I have suddenly realised the large amount of potential the story had and I won't say anything to put you off the premise . It's just that when the story continues after the events I've described things become more and more unlikely and bizarre . Not only that but the production values are fairly unimpressive with the actor playing Paul Cowley doing a very wooden voice over that irritates while most of the scenes - Exterior and interior - look like they've been filmed on a foggy day\n",

I found that 25 minutes into the movie  I really didn't care what happened anymore because the plot was overly obvious and I was bored.

      "I of course saw the previews for this at the beginning of some other Lion's Gate extravaganza  so of course it was only the best parts and therefore looked intriguing. And it is  to a point. A young college student (Sarah)is finding riddles all over the place and is becoming obsessed with answering them  and in doing so she's unwittingly becoming involved in some game. Now that's fairly intriguing right there but unfortunately it all gets rather muddled and becomes so complicated that the viewer (like myself) will most likely become frustrated. Characters appear with little introduction and you're not really sure who they are or why Sarah knows them or is hanging out with them. All of this has something to do with this woman who tried to drown a young boy years ago and her reason for that was that it's all part of the design. In reality  it's all part of the very sketchy script and when the film is over you'll find yourself feeling that you've lost about an hour and a half of your life that you want back for more productive uses of your time  like cleaning the bathroom  for instance. 4 out of 10.\n",

      "Wow  what's this on the video rental store's shelf in front of me? Nothing other than a questionable sequel to 8MM. It wasn't a very good sequel to a movie that had a very definitive end and an abundance of emotional depth far greater than this movie.  Basically  from the plot outline verbatim  an American diplomat  David Huxley  and his fiancée  Tish Harrington  venture into the sordid underworld of sex and pornography in Budapest  Hungary to find out who is blackmailing them with a porno video taken of them with a prostitute  Risa. The entire story is based around the various characters who make up these various sex clubs and strip joints throughout the city. The mystery is solved when  in the end  Tish finds out that the ransom money for the video and (essentially later on in the story) her fiancée which came out of her trust fund money is basically going back to her future husband as the story unfolds til the bitter end.  I didn't like how this had nothing to do with the original 8MM at all. The only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that it was  the fact that David ends up with some kind of bondage contraption over him to keep him prisoner looks like the kinky world of the first film  and the fact that the entire movie has sex emblazoned throughout almost every key scene. Otherwise  its a totally different movie. It made for a lousy love story  even before the end is known  which makes the ending more of a possibility because I didn't believe the words coming out of David's mouth the whole time. But we were warned that he was a liar about most things that might get him in trouble.  There were ridiculous nude scenes in most of the shocking moments of the film  which were trying to stir emotions in the audience to cheer for Tish to figure out the plot so she can leave this hellish sex debauchery. I counted at least 11 ridiculously filmed sequences when there was nothing but sex to be shown. Even the menu screen on the DVD is nothing but film with naked women on it to make the DVD seem totally provocative.  David was no heroic person throughout the film. You could guess he was the main problem long before the end. The actors who played each role were all new to me  which might explain how they got so many of them to strip down to gain acting respect. There were plot holes (How did David and Richard finally impress Tish's father by getting the lease they wanted when David was so wrapped up in this damn investigation to try and find a prostitute?) There were cheesy technology moments (like the talking email program dressed up like a bondage queen)  and a gay brother character which did nothing but show how the director was trying to get a Joaquin Phoenix knockoff to play this character. The tag line featured on this profile for this video is complete BS  too  because it wasn't even about a last breath. Nobody really dies. But they did have a good car crash sequence that came out of nowhere...but that was a good 10 seconds long out of an hour and 3/4 long movie.  Go rent (and maybe buy) the original. It's one of Joel Schumacher's better and more original films. It has everything better about it from this film. I wouldn't recommend seeing this unless you want to compare apples to oranges.\n",

I've never seen worse acting in my entire life. A kindergarten class could come up with a scarier  better written  and more entertaining concept than this. I pity anyone who wastes their time on this film  as well as the actors who agreed to doing the job. It was obvious that they were not given appropriate direction.

      "I am sorry folks  but I have to say I really cannot understand the overwhelming feelings everybody gets by seeing this movie...  When I saw it I looked at my watch to know how much more time I had to spend with this Kindergarten nonsense.  So why this verdict?  First of all: The movie tells a story that doesn't deliver any excitement! It is not even the amusingly distorted reality of a Quentin Tarantino we used to know. This story could have come out of every little kid's head. It doesn't have anything intelligent in it  neither anything inventive and it goes on for hours... the story has appropriate content for about 30 min. The rest is just awfully enhanced scenes that are supposed to leave a somewhat cool image. Doesn't work. Even the previously seen cutbacks that Tarantino often uses just confuse and are not in any way cool.   Second: Some guys go to Germany and kill Nazis. Ah really? Do they? The only Nazis they killed were a handful of guys  one of them being man enough to rather die than betray his companions. Is this the ugly face Tarantino wanted to give the Nazis? A brave soldier that is more valiant than any of the Basterds? Certainly not --> fail And what happens to the terrible Nazi-killing Basterds? Well they all get killed by Nazis except two who are taken hostages --> wow  what terrible revengeful monsters they are...  Third: Any characters? Yes one! The only role and the only gleam of hope for the entire movie is Chritoph Waltz who is building a truly deep and very detailed character here. Great acting! Brad Pitt really sucks and is completely out-acted by Waltz. Never seen a such a weak performance by Pitt... And the rest? Well  some Germans you've never seen before and will never see after. When the movie started and I saw the group of the seven Basterds I hoped to see something like the Magnificent Seven: A group of extraordinary guys  each one with a distinct character  making their way to their destiny fearless and knowing... I was then very disappointed  when I saw the inglourious Basterds. No details at all  no characters  no real men  just some random guys you won't remember who were not given any chance to differentiate themselves... But in fact you don't even need to differentiate  cause the Inglourious Basterds except Pitt hardly play any role in this movie...  So I was really disappointed  and seeing this movie on place #40 of the greatest movies of all time is the only thing about this  that leaves me with my mouth opened...\n",

      "Originally harped as a sequel to The Slumber Party Massacre series  this film falls flat on it's face with a new title. First off  if you are going to include the word massacre in your film's title  you better deliver. This one certainly does not. There is no gore  no on screen murders and no chainsaw  as the box art would lead you to believe. Instead  we get a paper thin  overdone plot about a group of cheerleaders who get stranded in an abandoned cabin on the way to a football game  only to be offed one by one. Again  this film could have been OK if the gore quotient was upped a bit. Why directors  especially those doing direct-to-video flicks  are afraid to show ANY gore is beyond me. Now  I am not a huge fan of excessive gore  but come on...why else would anyone rent a movie called Cheerleader Massacre?? Besides that problem  the film suffers from a shot-on-a-home-video-camera cheapness. It looks cheap  sounds cheap  and the actors aren't all that good. It tries to throw us off track to who the killer may be  but even that fails. The ending ends up being a ridiculous mess.

The actual plot (which basically is rather ingenious and intriguing) only becomes clear during an explication near the end  but the problem is that you stop caring a long time before. We see how horror icon Bela Lugosi infiltrates in a society of prominent American politicians and kills them one by one. The story is timed right before WWII and  especially after witnessing the ending  it surely is a premise with lots of potential  so it's quite a shame it isn't elaborated more proper.

The dialog was awful  the story line was impenetrable (I still don't understand what the hell was going on  despite having read the synopsis)  the camera work was disjointed and hopeless  the acting was wooden (not helped by the dialogue).  In fact there were no redeeming features - no  not even the lovely Sandra Bullock  on whose glittering subsequent career this pile of dross has probably been sold. She should get her agent to buy up all the rights to it and then bury it ASAP.  As a final amusing example of the director's ineptitude  there was a scene where the young lead is conversing with his father's ex-army sidekick while driving. This was the clearest bit of dialogue in the film - no engine noise whatsoever! I look forward to the engine-damping technology eventually making its way across the pond into British cars!\n",

      "I saw this on the shelves at the rental place and I have rented everything else so I said why not. Why not is because it's one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It looks like it was shot with home camcorder. I guess thats all the budget would allow. There was less boobs in it than I thought there would be. Some people made it out to be soft porn with a few killings. The funniest part of the whole movie to me is in the extra stuff. There is a spot with deleted scenes. Well there is only one but it is the dumbest and I think it may have brought the rest of the movie down. The girls get in a hot tub and find some chocolate syrup in the bathroom. Yes it ends up all over them. Great stuff !!! This movie is very very bad. Don't bother.\n",

      "This movie reminded me a lot of a song by the Dead Kennedys called Straight A's. However  unlike this film  the hero of the DK's song turns to suicide. You'll wish this bozo had resorted to killing himself instead of doing the crime he did. The whole thing was convoluted and in the beginning  you sympathize with the hero of the film  then he quickly betrays your sympathies. The long sequences of just showing the hero's face while he delivers a monologue drag the film down quite a bit. Avoid this if possible.\n",

      "Being an admitted chess addict  I was excited to see a documentary about the 1997 rematch between Garry Kasparov and IBM's Deep Blue supercomputer. I was hoping to see an in depth look at the match and a lot of what Kasparov had to say. Boy was I wrong and misguided by a mile. This documentary is a lot like many modern documentaries - there is a lot of flash but no real substance. After watching it  I am sad to say  I felt like I wasted my time. One of the most annoying aspects about the documentary is that it does not stay at one place for a decent period of time. It has the typical MTV type editing  where the camera shows different images and quick sound bites from people every five seconds. It is very sad that film-making has been watered down to the attention span of a 10-year old child.  I understand it is difficult to make a film about chess  but that does not mean one should make it flashy. 'Game Over' did have a couple of interesting ideas though. It brought up the idea whether computers can think like human beings or not; whether computers have advanced to a unique new level. This is what Kasparov thought after the match  but this film does not go deep enough with this idea. Also  this film tries to bring in a bizarre theory. It tries to imply the paranoid that a human being was making the moves along with the help of the computer. Kasparov had suspicions about this  but still to this day there is no evidence. Towards the end of the film  it tries to imply the bizarre that maybe Anatoly Karpov might have been the human being who was secretly making the moves with the aid of Deep Blue. Interesting to think about  but I don't know how plausible or realistic it is. I still would not recommend this movie though  not even for chess addicts.\n",

      "Ed Gein  one of the most famous serial killers of all time  he was the inspiration for famous movie killers like Norman Bates  Leatherface  and Buffalo Bill. He is also one of the most sick and disturbing killers of all time  I watched a documentary on him  so I know his story pretty well. When I saw this  I was curious because I thought it was supposed to be like a documentary re-enactment  but I have to say that this was just a pathetic waste of time. First off  the facts are completely wrong  with a few minor exceptions  and secondly  this was just a stupid Hollywood story when these horrific murders really happened and they just made it into a cheap buck. Not to mention that if they were going to make it into a horror movie  this was poorly acted!   Ed Gein  he lives in a small town in Wisconsin called Plainfield  but he has a little secret that the whole town is being effected by  he digs up dead bodies  as well as brutally murdering people. Bobby  a deputy  is on the case to get Ed Gein  only  no one knows who the killer is at first  just finding crime scene after crime scene. But things get personal when Ed starts messing with the policemen's family and friends.  Of course this movie was just ridicules and completely insulting to the true story. I always thought that bad acting is a necessary tool to a horror flick  but for this story  it should have been a better acted film  not to mention  it should have been more of a documentary than a stupid cliché'd horror film. Please  stay away from this film  it's completely pathetic and untrue to the story of Ed Gein.  1/10\n",

      "In 4 words  Captain Corelli's Mandolin was completely out of tune with the book. The novel provided sufficient character background to understand the relationships and personal challenges the characters needed to overcome; the script writer chose to ignore the details. In ignoring them (e.g. the priest's role initially as a buffoon  but later as a spiritual leader  the fiancee's inability to read until taught by a socialist rebel  the bomb experts advice to Corelli and his eventual ironic demise)  the story and characters fall flat.  This was the first movie that I've ever walked out of midway through. Interesting cinematography  great actors do not MAKE a film; the story does.\n",

      "Hi there. I watched the first part when it came out  and I don't remember having left such a bad impression on me as this one.  First  the animation is choppy  wooden  not worked on  lacks naturality - I understand the drawing style was to be of some 'atlantean' kind  but  it could be done with the usual Disney finesse... see Tarzan to see what I mean. If I didn't see the DISNEY logo in the beginning  I would never say it was a Disney movie.  Second  the plot was more like a PC game style  like a good old quest. Not that it was bad  but it lacked a story that binds the viewer to the characters and their goals. It was inconvincing  at least. The film was meant for children  but this was waaay to childish at times.  Third  the music... I would say it was improper  but it just fits the whole scene with the plot and animation...  Overall  I think this was some kind of an amusement  just by-the-way kind of project by several apprentice animators  just to fill in the count for Disney movies. Sorry to hear that from myself  a big Disney lover...\n",

      "A montage prologue  quite obviously manufactured by the blessed maniacs who actually chose to distribute this thing  tries to convince us that the comic impact of this staggeringly incompetent bit of nothing is entirely deliberate. Don't you believe it: this is to Lloyd Kaufman as Andy Warhol is to Herschel Gordon Lewis. It is so thoroughgoing in its project of torturing its hypothetical audience that it seems like some kind of misanthropic negationist art installation  only it can't be because it is so completely bereft of self-consciousness. As obnoxious and ugly as Things or Frozen Scream  this manages to up the ante by recycling itself with a maddeningly bald insistence that has to be seen to be believed. A Hitchcock-style shot-by-shot analysis of  say  the attack on the cardio girls might yield twenty edits and perhaps three minutes of footage - only the sequence is ten minutes long! You WANT to believe that this started life as a slightly more bearable short subject  except if you took away the repetition what's left would be far less fascinating: eg. when the 'fiend' does enter the room  he only inspires extended  highly apathetic  utterly blank stares from his imminent (offscreen) victims. Repeat this scenario about four times  in marginally varied settings; bridge these with perhaps thirty lines of dialogue total; offer up actors even more hateful and lethargic than those in the above mentioned classics; and grace us with a monster comprising gauze  ketchup and one yellow Spock ear  and you've got a movie too mind-boggling to refuse  a working definition of bad.

But fortunately he isn't the only one to blame. First of all the complete storyline is totally weak dealing with a gunmen looking for a murderer while Kinski is stuck up in jail for a crime he did not commit. That's all. All the dialogs and characters are so bad it's making you scream. But maybe that's the fun of it all. If you know the Kinski-Biography it's obvious that Kinski didn't care about those movies at all. Especially all his Italo-Western roles. He just took the money and that was It. again  this whole movie is totally weird. Only for hardcore-Fans of the genre.\n",

      "I have to agree with the other two comments. I waited over a month to see this great new show A&E had been hyping. What a disappointment!!! The show is pretty much all about Ryan Buell. His voice-overs are campy  not creepy. It sounds as if he is talking into a can. As of the second episode  which is roughly 30 minutes or so (if you take out the commercials) he is being chased or followed by something that he knows is demonic. He can't say the name  anytime someone needs to convey that name  they write it on a piece of paper and hand it to someone else. Not particularly informative or entertaining or believable for the rest of us. Why can't he say the name?...supposedly it would give the demon more power. Funny  I always thought demons wanted to hide their true identities. If you know the exact name of the demon  doesn't it make it easier for you to cast them out. Now the next episode  which airs in just a little while is titled exorcism. So is Ryan in need of an exorcism already? Not to say that it couldn't happen but the show so far has not given any evidence or proof of anything. I can tell Ryan that if I were a small child  hell if I was an adult  and someone gave me a little bottle of holy water to chase away something that was terrifying me  I would look elsewhere for help!!! Besides which  if you don't use holy water & blessings  etc. in the right way don't you risk just further infuriating whatever is already mad at you? I will probably watch tonight but if these episodes are as ridiculous as the first  it will probably be the last time I watch it!\n",

At my school  those in grade 7 and higher must have Apple Macbooks (this is payed for in the entrance fee). Moving on. This show is very annoying. It has boring  predictable plots and bad acting. Often in the show it brings girl power to a new high  with girls beating guys in everything they try. But that is not the worst. The worst is that girls are nevertheless all portrayed as being focused on their personal appearances  and screaming whenever they are happy. Except for the one smart girl  who is portrayed as a freak who is obsessed with ugly boys and science. However  this show is very addictive. I do not know why  but it is. Although  the most recent season has been SO terrible  bringing the stereotypes  boring plots  and bad acting to extremes I never thought were reachable  so I am no longer addicted  thankfully.\n",

      "Dear SciFi Channel: How have you been? How was your summer? I've been OK  but I feel like our relationship isn't the same anymore and we're growing apart. I don't understand why you don't love me anymore. I've just finished watching your SciFi Channel Original Skeleton Man and  once again  you've shown a blatant lack of respect for my feelings by KILLING OFF EVERY HOT GIRL IN THIS MOVIE!!! I mean  I understand that you're just in this for instant gratification. All you care about is producing a movie where people get sliced and diced by a homicidal Indian spirit/creature/legend/whatever. So you really don't have time to put some thought and effort into anything else -- like finding a costume for Skeleton Man that doesn't make him like the gay lover of Skeletor from He-Man. Seriously  his robe looks like a satin blanket sheet and his skull is smooth as a baby's behind  he almost looks like a killer Halloween-costume-for-a-6-year-old as he marches through the wilderness on a homicidal rampage. So we throw you a bone  because we're not looking for Oscar-winning performances  intriguing plot or realistic character reactions to the situations at hand. Because we realize that even though Michael Rooker  Caspar van Diem and all the girls are supposed to be trained Special Ops agents  they are all mysteriously transformed into Keystone Kops who can't shoot or see straight whenever Skeleton Man appears. And we also fully expect that nothing -- bullets  explosions  electrocution  nothing -- can kill Skeleton Man until there is one minute left in the movie and we need to find a way to tie things up neatly. We expect to see blood and guts. But you have a knack for taking the least attractive actress in the entire cast and making her the only female who survives. And quite honestly  I think you do it just to antagonize me. Because this movie  as silly as it is  has the potential to be a so-bad-it's-good classic and just killing off all the hotties ruins everything -- and forces me to lower its rating. All I ask is that once  just once  you take my feelings into account and let the sexiest girls survive the movie. Please.\n",

      "This is just dreadful. I regret every second of the 80 minutes I spent watching this dreck. I think it's supposed to be a comedy  but I don't remember laughing much  except at a few blatant inconsistencies and downright glaring errors.  An unattractive middle-aged man called Lester meets up with rich unattractive middle-aged women via lonely hearts ads  and then murders them for the money he needs to feed his gambling addiction. That's the whole plot  and that's really all that happens. Along the way there is an attempt at intrigue when Lester starts to get phone calls from a mysterious stranger who taunts him about knowing his secret  but its so badly implemented  you may not realise what is actually supposed to be happening. The sequences in which Lester murders the rich widows are all quite brutal but also seemingly dressed up as comedies. One sequence has a woman bludgeoned with a wooden pole and then shoved into an oven. It's very cruelly depicted  but it is played out against blaring big-band waltz music  with Lester pulling faces and adopting comedy poses throughout. Another scene has the victim murdered while she constantly sings shrill opera songs...you have to see this to believe it! Actually - you don't have to see it at all  in fact I strongly recommend you avoid this flop. Fulci does not seem to know which hat he is wearing and there's no evidence of any of the flair seen in his earlier career. One sequence stood out to me as particularly wretched: the revelation when Lester suddenly realises that he has no shadow. Fulci seems unable to think up any visual representation of this phenomena on screen  so from this point on he just films the actor as normal  shadow and all!! And thus totally blows the whole angle. Either he had zero budget for effects  or he just didn't care enough to think up any way of showing it. Whatever it was  that should give you a taste of how lame this whole project is. I couldn't even understand most of the film  and there certainly wasn't anything on screen worth looking at half the time. Even the ending was as flat as a pancake. A real dud.\n",

Around the age of five or six  I loved it  tracked it down only three or four years later and found it to be wet  poorly animated  dully and confusingly written  and with distressingly repetitive and awful songs (I'm looking t you  hi-cockalorum)  showing a production aiming at joyful silliness and whimsy  but resulting with an ugly  twee  frustrating mess.  By all means  show this to your infant  but I would heartily recommend that you don't buy a copy or attempt to sit in on the viewing.

      "How is this a documentary? Much more like a walking ghost tour one might take in any given Southern city. Quotes were generously dropped throughout without the first effort at identifying the source. George Orwell was the most identified quoter.   Documents were referred to without ever being produced in any form. Flat out fraudulent shots depicting period film stock were spliced aside historical film reels with no separation from reality and self-promotion. Film reels which were entirely unrealistic and improbable for the time at hand were dropped in  as if trying to ape Blair Witch  hoping to drum up a spook house on what would otherwise simply be dead real estate.   Is this not in some way a great disrespect to actual victims of TB  a dance on their collective graves for the sake of commercialism? The line between actual footage and manufactured self-service is so thin; the drippings of doubt so insignificantly played down; the scientific boundaries so blatantly ignored... how could this possibly be listed in my TiVo as documentary?

      "A friend and I went to see this movie. We have opposite opinions about Fujimori but after watching this movie we agree on the following: the easiest way to have an inaccurate documentary is to make it about a foreign country in which you were not present when the events happened  no matter how talented or how much you invest in the film. If you are truly looking to learn about another countries history  watch something made by natives of that country otherwise you won't be able step away from your bubble. And those who try to force their views and opinions about something to which they don't belong are really abusing their power. To make it even worse  the director chose to not talk about the embarrassing involvement of the CIA with Fujimori's regime. She decides to evade dealing with the only subject for witch her country has much to explain to Peruvians. But this is not surprising because  both  the director and the CIA are violating the sovereignty of Peru by trying to affect the democratic processes at very different levels of course.  If the director was really interested in helping Peru she would have financed a native to make the documentary. In any case there are numerous Peruvian made documentaries  films and books about the subject. Such include Ojos Que No Ven  Dias de Santiago  Montesinos-Fujimori: Las Dos Caras de la Misma Moneda  Montesinos: Poderoso Caballero  etc. The director of the Fall of Fujimori should spend her time analyzing the numerous problems in her own country or at least the involvement of her country in the matters of other nations.\n",

      "I watched this out of curiosity. I enjoyed Stargate SG1 and I've watched many of the other TV shows and movies that the principal characters have worked on.  My expectations weren't high  so I was surprised to be so monstrously disappointed.  The acting throughout is appalling  and the script is worse.   Zero research into the bad science that is spouted throughout the movie  or into martial arts (which several cast members engage in throughout the movie  despite clearly having no martial arts training (baton twirling does not a warrior make)) training makes the already implausible plot even less credible. The same weapon (carried by Michael Shanks)  when shot at the side of a mountain  causes extreme damage  but when shot indoors at the wall made of wicker  creates a small fireworks effect without damaging the wicker structure - OK  I suppose Michael Shanks fans will be sued to seeing that in Stargate SG1  where a staff weapon creates either a surface burn on a main character  or blasts a hole in a section of castle wall as required)  but still... A bad CGI snake 'god' eats one of the faithful in the way a dog would eat - snakes just don't behave like that.  The basic premise of an amazonian warrior cult on a distant planet is silly at best. Matriarchal societies have always been based on a lack of understanding that men are required in the process of propagating the species - for instance  the Picts  who didn't figure out the role of men in sexual reproduction until the ninth century - at which time  the balance of power moved from the women to the men. They carry technological weapons and demonstrate some knowledge of science - particularly of medicine  so the idea that a matriarchal society could exist with this level of scientific knowledge is based purely on the original author's wet dream. Of course  the few references to stellar science made in this movie demonstrate that the author knew nothing about that either (except for a few keywords that he must have heard in other movies). Still  it could have been done better - like 'She' in 1965 for instance  which showed matriarchal society with a certain reverence  far more believably  and even after 45 years it seems fresher than this fetid exercise in stupidity. Marching a few women around in 'armour'  pouting aggressively  and spitting out their lines like a kiddie looking for a fight in a nightclub (Come on then! I'll do ya! style)  seems to be over-simplifying the complexities of a matriarchal culture.  The cultural references are so simple - 'all hail the snake mother' pretty much sums it all up. Even the tiniest hamlet shows more cultural variation.   There is nothing clever  thought-provoking  interesting  visually exciting  or remotely entertaining about this movie. The soundtrack is of similar quality.  I can only assume that the few  overly-charitable positive reviews this movie has received are from blinkered Michael Shanks fans who will give a thumbs up to anything he's involved in. Don't be fooled. Low budgets are not a reason for a film to fail - cheap B movies can be brilliant. This isn't one of them  and there's no reason to inflict this movie on yourself.\n",

This one did. It kept me guessing. I cared about the story. I cared about the characters. The acting was decent. Unfortunately  about half way through the movie  the story just doesn't have many good directions it can go. It becomes evident that everything cool about the plot is going to self-destruct. It does. What builds in the first half as a great horror concept shifts away from horror and towards the absurd. A plausible fear turns into a series of implausible reactions from the characters.

It could have been a good movie  and the plot itself I don't see as male bashing  but certain specific references to men get really annoying. I might still watch the movie again though because it does at least try to redeem itself by hinting that maybe the women in the movie aren't really as non-violent as they claim  but it still doesn't compensate for the really tiring male-bashing. I mean  I can understand a little  it's part of the movie's plot  but come on  it gets really tiring after awhile. Not only that  but to assume that the majority of women in the world would accept becoming homosexual that easily and that the few remaining heterosexuals would be such a minority as to go in the closet. It's just too unbelievable. There are far too many women out there with cultural or religious restrictions that would balk at this it is totally implausible. I mean I know its sci-fi  and I love sci-fi  but the best sci-fi has at least a hint of it being possible  and this is too implausible.

Dick Sargent was not convincing as a villain least of all this guy was suppose to be super evil...he was more annoying then anything. Peter Graves was the only person the movie that wasn't awful  his part was small and even he couldn't compensate for his co-stars lack of talent. In 2004 someone tried to make this mess all over again it was called The Island...I personally didn't see that movie but from what i understand its the same movie. If you want to laugh at this movie get the MST3k episode its really funny...full of bewitched and biography references it makes this movie finally watchable\n",

Nothing can be further from the truth. This is the absolute most sad movie experience I've ever had... It is plain and right AWFUL and should not be sold or rented to anyone. If you still think the plot seems intriguing  reflect on this: telephones can move  run and kill people as can also any other electric appliance. It can throw things at you  haunt you and run after you. PLEASE DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE it is a disgrace for the horror genre...\n",

      "Incomprehensibly dreadful mishmash of the probably most notorious of all Roman emperors who went insane  leaving infamous party orgies and ruthless killings in his path... I know there are several versions of this  and this is based on the 102 min' one that I watched - but I can't fathom how that possibly can make any difference to lift the rest of this movie out of the muck!  I'd heard for long about the alleged shocking content of sex/nudity (which honestly there isn't much of here at all - and boring when there is) and blood  but beware - it's the technical production amateurishness that well and truly shocks here: Everything looks plain and simply like a junior film school flunk project! Camera-work is hopelessly inept  full of strange zooms  failed framing and confusing pans (to and from what mostly looks like a huge theater stage!) complete with a grainy  cheapish photo quality. Lighting and color schemes are terrible and uneven - is it day or night? Are they in- or outside? Have they changed scenes? Who is  or is meant to be in the shot? Editing is the final sin here  making a confusing mess of everything with randomly jumpy cutaways  continuity flaws and random transitions that destroy any chance of momentum  story progression - and involvement. There is potentially interesting dialog and an equally interesting true historical story... but these faults distract so much it's tragic.  A story with SO many possibilities to be great is just one gargantuan  burnt (and Fellini-like) turkey that's only good for a few gobble-laughs and Peter O'Toole  who makes a most memorable Tiberius. Oh yes  which brings us to the big-name actors. I'd like to line them all up one by one and just ask: Who did you get free access to bonk in the orgies to be a part of this? There  I've wasted enough lines on one of the truly worst films of all time - period!  1 out of 10 from Ozjeppe\n",

      "the stupid government once again attempted to create an inexhaustible and indestructible soldier  and of course the experiments went terribly wrong  burdening us with a half man-half mutant who pukes an awful lot and squeaks like a little girl whenever he's upset. Lance Henriksen stars as the honest scientist who immediately quit the experiment upon hearing it was a military project  but he returns (bringing the whole family with him) when he finds out his beloved guinea pig has gone on a killing spree. Mind Ripper certainly is a watchable horror movie  but it's very unoriginal and features pretty much every lame cliché you can think off (including the estranged father/rebellious teenage son sub plot...yawn). The characters are like wooden puppets  the dumbest things are being said and done and there's a completely pointless dream-sequence...coming from the monster!!! There's a handful of interesting gory scenes to enjoy and some of the isolated desert-locations are effectively eerie. Lance Henriksen is adequate as always  even though this is yet another inferior production he stars  and Giovanni Ribisi surely deserved a better motion picture to make his debut in. For some reason  this anonymous 90's thriller is also known as The Hills Have Eyes part 3. Is it because it handles about members of the same family being terrorized in the desert? Is it because Wes Craven was once again involved  as a producer this time? Or maybe it's because the monster gets bald near the end like the freaky Michael Berryman in the 1977 original? Who knows...Who cares? Wes Craven probably financed this project because his son co-wrote the script and it's always moving to discover that your offspring is equally untalented as you are.

      "This movie was *good* relatively during the first parts of it.  We have a story  from 3 points of view. So let's find some clues and complete the story.  Oh wait...none of that stuff matters because the FBI guys are the bad guys! Though that was a great twist...it was almost a terrible twist. I immediately downgraded the film from a 7 maybe 8 to 3 based on the last 10-15 minutes of it.  Does anyone else not see why the twist is so bad? Yes  it's a good shock. But it is bad because it has absolutely nothing to do with the preceding hour and twenty minutes. There's no connection to the killers.  The killers are in about all of 5 minutes of this movie (as killers) and the two FBI agents are only in 15 minutes of the previous hour and twenty.  We get it...surveillance...Oh  the Killers are voyeurs. WHICH MAKES NO SENSE  because they were only described in limited terms as just being psychopaths. And the hour and twenty minutes of surveillance we are watching of the 3 stories goes out the window as everyone is dead in 5 minutes.  All of this makes the ending even more ridiculous. Oh  they killed a bunch of FBI agents in the beginning...what FBI agents sleep together? All in the same room. To be found and murdered by amateurs and then impersonated by people who know nothing about being FBI agents? A cop 3 feet away apparently can't hit either one with a standard police issue pistol that can shoot several shots. I hate movies that try to make you feel like this could be real when they make absurd leaps they think we will believe.  The other thing is the movie ends about 10-15 minutes after they are revealed as the killers with a girl standing in the field somewhere...\n",

Well  I found this one in a bargain bin and brought it as a selection to a movie night with a group of friends.  I was  literally  *emabrrassed* that I brought this movie.  Right from the beginning  the acting is bad  the story is bland and the plot is almost non-existent. All this leads right to what the movie really was: A soft core porno graphical movie.  The movie started with a woman prison where the prisoners are all sexy women working in some sort of mine. First clue that this movie is NOT serious: attractive women in a prison being forced to do physical labor. Yeah  right! Whatever. :P Once the plot continued  it was overshadowed by pointless scenes of people having sex. Halfway through the movie  my friends and I stopped watching  it was so stupid. The next day  I thought that I would give the movie another chance and watch the rest. I watched about another 15 minutes and gave up again.

The scenes where the President (Holbrook) were downtown and walking among the people were a farce. There would not be a chance for the common folk to be within 30 yards of the President in that situation in real life. If it wasn't for the blood and profanity  this was shot like a TV movie. It could have been decent if it was done differently. Holbrook's (President) talents were never realized in this movie. Shatner's acting is okay.

The only match is a convicted serial killer  who escapes from jail. To save his son he has to track down the killer.  Michael Keaton plays the convict in one of many disappointing aspects of the film. Keaton is a great actor at times but here he is pretty much boring. It's over-the-top to the point where you just stop caring.  Garcia is better but tries too hard for a film that isn't up to par. Barbet Schroeder (at one time such a promising director with films like Barfly that amounted to pretty much nothing in the American market) directs well enough - I honestly thought the script was the culprit here...it's just a big mess.  The film ultimately wastes a lot of good material  good actors and a good director - all because of a faulty script.

      "Well  here we have a zombie movie that perhaps isn't even being much of a zombie movie. The entire movie is set in a zombie-plagued near future but yet the movie does very little with this concept. Instead it focuses on a zombie hunter who is trying to get revenge and his money back from a group of other bounty hunters. What good is money anyway when almost the entire world has gone to hell and towns are mostly desolate. And why pay money to people for killing zombies in the first place. As if people would not go on to kill this dangerous threatening monsters when they are not getting paid.  Needless to say that the story for The Quick and the Undead is far from a tight one. It of course also isn't being filled with the most logical and interesting moments  characters or dialog.  Still it's not a completely horrible movie. It certainly ain't as bad as some people try to make you believe it is. It's a rather good looking one  or rather said the movie at least doesn't have a cheap look over it. It's effects may be a bit overused but nevertheless they are quite good looking  as are the make-up effects as well.  Still the movie was not what I hoped of it. Its title might suggest that the movie is set in the wild  wild west  during the days of the cowboys but its title is just a misleading one  no doubt picked to cash in on it. I fell for it  expecting this movie to be a combination of a western and a gory zombie-horror-flick.  For the fans of the zombie movies this movie will mostly be a disappointment to watch. It of course adds nothing new to the genre but it also doesn't has enough of the genre itself in it to be considered a good one to watch.  Not totally unwatchable but also far from a recommendable one.  4/10\n",

      "This movie was absolutely terrible. The only explanation I can think of for the good reviews it received from some here is that they were written by people in the cast. It was actually painful to watch this movie. Even my grandchildren (ages 6-13) could not bear to watch it. As far as I know  this movie never made it to theaters and for good reason. It's as if some people were sitting around having a beer and said  Hey! Let's make a movie. Who wants to be in it? It's that bad. Besides Luke Perry  who is only in a small part of the movie  I did not recognize a single other actor. That's not necessarily a bad thing but it is in this case. I liked Sandlot (I) and I generally like stupid and silly movies but this movie doesn't have a single redeeming quality. The people who wrote it don't have the slightest clue as to how children think  talk  or act and the movie is a disjointed mess of terribly corny lines and stupid jokes. I rarely write negative reviews but this is the worst movie I have seen since Man's Best Friend and it's definitely one of the ten worst movies I have ever seen in my life.

      "One hundred and seventy five million dollars is a hell of a lot of money to spend on even the biggest summer blockbuster. Not even Michael Bay had a budget that big for Transformers  so exactly how Universal Pictures spent that much cash making Evan Almighty is a mystery. They certainly didn't spend it on the script for one thing as the film is not so much a classic comedy as it is Christian flag waving and bar one or two quiet chuckles  you're most likely to spend the duration wondering where the budget went or why Steve Carrell felt the need to slum it in a decidedly average movie at the exact moment when his star profile has begun to rise.  A sequel to the Jim Carrey comedy Bruce Almighty  this film sees former supporting character Evan Baxter (Carrell) moving up the ladder into the main player slot. The story opens with him leaving the news desk to become a public official and moving to Washington with his wife and three generic sons (slightly weird primary school moppet  spirited middle schooler and sulky teenager). Evan's bid to change the world through politics however gets a spanner in the works when God (Morgan Freeman) appears and asks him to build an Ark.  In other words  it's an updating of the old Genesis story  with Evan fighting off cynicism and naysayers to build the immense boat. Unfortunately  while the premise is reasonably promising  it sadly does not provide many laughs. There's a bit of fun to be had in the early going where Evan's straight-laced MP tries to juggle the demands of public service with the unwelcome packs of animals that follow him around and a beard that resists all attempts to shave it  but as soon as he accepts his divine mission  the film takes a nosedive.  From this point on  it turns into a message movie. Evan begins preaching with alarming regularity and Morgan Freeman keeps turning up to offer kind wisdom  while gently prodding his chosen in the right direction. Without Evan's resistance though  the only trace of comedy left comes in the form of a few rubbish animal-feces jokes and John Michael Higgin's role as Evan's exasperated right-hand man. Higgins may show the same rich comic potential that he did previously in Arrested Development  but his enthusiasm cannot save the sinking vessel  especially seeing as Carrell has all but placed his formidable improv skills on the back-burner.  In some respects  it's slightly similar to the Passion of the Christ  but unlike Mel Gibson's movie which encouraged everyone to believe in God through blood letting and guilt tripping  Evan Almighty tries a more gentle approach. The movie simply tells us that we should have faith in God  because He has faith in us. Unfortunately  this movie is just as likely to make you laugh as the Passion is. Carrell is on autopilot  the jokes don't exist and Wanda Sykes makes a bid to become the most annoying person on the planet. It might be sweet  but somebody just tossed $175 000 000 overboard.\n",

And leaving out important events which happened at the time  one is henry's fall out with Rome over his desire to divorce Katherine of aragon which led to england's breaking away from Rome and establishing her own church. they barely stuck to the book at all. i'm all for creative freedom but to a limit  especially when your dealing with a well written book as your starter point. in the book Mary give's birth to young Catherine first and then she has young Henry is born.

In order to achieve this  they have to use a very slow narration and have everyone run around with some implausible frantic angst. By the time this movie showed anything interesting in the plot  I just didn't care. The problem is not in the acting  but instead the pacing. The story is just weak. Jim Carrey is a capable actor  but his attempts to inject light humor into a serious role is just out of place. His style of humor is not generic  so he comes across as a watered down version of himself. The number 23 causes great grief and frustration to the people in the story  but the justification for this is never logical. At most it's just mildly interesting. Jim Carrey has far more ability in a serious role than this movie reveals. Don't waste your money seeing this in the theater. Rent this movie if you've had problems sleeping. If you are still wide awake after 10 minutes  then you liked it more than I did. I was not fond of the lighting and artistic aspects of the film making either.

I guess the appeal lies in a type of smug voyeurism of wanting to see bad things happen to bad mens' bottoms   but I found Don Siegel's RIOT IN CELL BLOCK 11 to be rather disappointing . Okay I knew since it was made in 1954 it would be devoid of bad language   graphic shankings and gang rape but even so it's a rather weak film compared to prison portrayal in earlier movies like EACH DAWN I DIE and WHITE HEAT . The problem lies in the preachy tone of the movie with riot leader Dunn being something of a prison reformer . Yeah that sounds ridiculous since he's a violent anti hero rather than some limp wristed tree hugging do gooder on a salary   but that's what he is in essence   he wants to see prisoners rehabilitated to rejoin society rather than being made to suffer . There's also a problem of making a B movie with such radical themes ( Quite ironic that Siegel would later make DIRTY HARRY where the only good criminal is a dead one ) and that is the cast isn't very good with Emile Meyer as the warder being especially irritating in his performance . like i said a disappointing movie\n",

      "Predictable  cliche  unbelievable  boring...what else can I say? It's only the caliber of the cast that saves any redeeming qualities of this bloated mess. Oh yeah  and the entertaining end zone antics.  But wait for the eleven o'clock highlights  'cause the outcome is as predictable as who's going to win the Globetrotters/Washington Generals matchup.  I was well into the second act before I figured out these were supposed to be PRO teams we were watching (all clad in vintage Padres brown). And Cameron Diaz character's imitation of a youthful Georgia Frontiere was ill-conceived on the page. (Not your fault  Cameron. Would you like to go to dinner?)  Enough of this - I'm only on a rant because I was looking forward to this film. Rent THE LONGEST YARD instead.  \n",

      "This movie is very much like every other modern horror movie. It's predictable in the way it gets build up and progresses and just never succeeds in bringing anything original or shocking to the screen. That's really the biggest disappointment of the movie  that overall still had a promising main concept for a movie of its sort.  You can call this movie a big walking modern horror movie cliché. It has all of the elements in it that make modern horror movies often not so very great ones to watch. One of these aspects is a moaning and very naive little kid. Why do they keep putting this sort of stuff in movies? Same goes for the sort of drama aspects  that involves the family. It just doesn't work out for the movie and is far from interesting or effective. It often instead causes the movie to drag in parts and become an annoying one to watch.   So it has all of the clichés present but it also doesn't succeed at bringing any of these clichés well to the screen. As an horror movie this simply is a very poor one. It doesn't handle its horror or tension very well. For the fans of the genre there is very little to enjoy. The movie its story isn't too well connected and build up within the movie. Too often the movie sleeps in at parts and it doesn't ever allow its horror to fully kick in.  The movie is also often way too dark (no doubt as an attempt to hide its fairly low budget) and it shows very little gore as well  mostly due to the fact that you simply can not always see things so very well.  You can just tell by looking at this movie that director J.S. Cardone doesn't has much talent for the genre and doesn't know how to handle its present ingredients properly. He did some attempts in the past but all of his movies have failed so far. he just keeps trying unfortunately. Who knows  perhaps with the right people behind the camera's (like Tobe Hooper  who was initially attached to direct) this movie still could had been something decent.  It's a poorly cast movie  with mostly big unknowns in it. Biggest name of the movie is Ben Cross but his role is just way too small and in a way also not really relevant enough for the movie and its story. It didn't even seemed like he had much fun playing.  Just skip it.  4/10\n",

      "I'm an atheist. To me history and truth mean a lot.  This film is made after a novel published in 1921  which is still being updated up to this day as if it was a history book. Well it's not. The movie is about the novels 1950s version. Some actors were GREAT but that doesn't cover the plot.  In short man invents a super-bomb so God and his friends hold a tribunal to see if they must intervene. The devil analogy persecutes man  and for defense we have the spirit of man. What is the spirit of man anyway? And why was the first defendant Adam? Eventually you just get US Christian propaganda in a 5th grade history book of the time. Though other religions are mentioned  only European Christianity is explored.  First we get the caveman story. The women are scrawny stereotypes of damsels in distress. Real cave women were as strong as men and just as resistant. Hard times  hard life  adapt and survive. All this is watered down by mid-century stereotypes.  Next we get Egypt's first pyramid construction. Today we see a different story and know that there were a lot less deaths and regular citizens at work as well. Loosing mentioned amount of many lives in the process would have been a national disaster and nobody after would try to beat it. As if there was only ONE pyramid build.  The part about Moses and one true god was as if the Spanish inquisition was asking nicely. Inquisition itself was never even mentioned in the movie.  Helen of Troy's evil grim was so vile that I didn't see why so many were even interested in her. In reality they were just soldiers  following commanders orders  who were discussing a political issue of power. She was just an excuse.  The Cleopatra story was were I saw this film was to inaccurate and filled with propaganda. Here brother was a LOT younger. She was not obsessed with poison  was quite educated to restore library content  and was politically competitive to drag beaten down Egypt out of dirt.  The part with Nero and praying Christians in a cave were disgusting. Yes  Rome burned down. Yes  there was persecuted Christianity. But the way they portray it was as if the Coliseum build itself and there was no Vespasian to rebuild Rome.  Attila the Hun appears in a short seen and than we jump to King Arthur. The crusades are mentioned with minimal bloodshed. And there is no mention of the crusades east to Russia that ended in an ironic battle. The knights just went home and started jousting for fun of it. A LOT of stuff is put down like no indoor pluming  hygiene and plagues.  Then they cover Joan of Ark  where she always has to much makeup and looks like a princes. Territorial politics were replaced with an unjust court. The sidesaddle alone on a stool makes me want to ask how someone could follow here. At here burning I wanted to yell Hura! Now die already! Cheap special effects  where is the fire?.  By the time they mentioned Leonardo I already got fed up with the movie. Columbus  Spanish slaughter of America  yelling Queen Elisabeth kick the Spanish armada and so on and so on.  The ONLY reason I wanted to see this movie was the fact that it was the last one with all 3 Marks brothers. And all they got was the scene with Manhattan and Indians. Amusing  but no more than a smile.  The witch-hunts are mentioned briefly  as well as plagues (after renascence). When they start portraying revolutions  things gut power-hungry and anarchistic. The US revolution was pursued by the French revolution. Oppression and incompetence are bad  but you can't just blow the old way up out of anger  you must replace it with something. So they replaced the French monarchy with new French monarchy. So we get Napoleon and his ambitions to go to India by land. But they replace his motives with unity and band him for only the title Emperor. The conquests in Europe  defeat in Russia are sacked to Waterloo.  The US civil war  the English rich inventors (Tesla not included). Mister Watson  come here  I want you almost made me laugh for teenage reasons. Technological hard work was watered down to the final discovery and comedic misuse.  Eventually after 85 minutes we come to world wars and organized crime  but none of its horrors. Adolph's words I invade Russia. This is my last territorial demand were hilarious. It was his LAST territorial demand.  To build suspense God puts a countdown clock to doomsday on the wall for the final words. All mighty cant pause the universe for a second? There was no need for the persecution speech but the defense made one last throw.  Last we see the man of tomorrow as the final defense. Apparently a paradox man  because the bomb was to go of today. His toys are a music box in the shape of a gun and a pencil box sword. Now that is so wrong",
      " Pens and pencils drew so many weapon blueprints that its kill count surpasses the atom bomb. And making music out of a weapon? Deluded egoistic generals make music out of weapon fire. So the man of tomorrow is already a monster.  The way I see it  all the defense had to do was blame the devil as the true conspirator for mans demise and case closed. And honestly  compared to all barbaric stuff our ancestors did centuries ago we are pretty humane at painless backstabbing these days.  To summarize all I will just quote Fireflys episode Jaynestown: It's my estimation that every man ever got a statue made of him was one kind of son of bitch or another. Ain't about you  Jayne. It's about what they need.\n",

      "I had neither read any of the books nor seen the first movie so after receiving passes to a preview show  I had no expectations.  'Angels and Demons' was a muddled  convoluted film lacking direction or any believability. There was very little character development and I never found myself caring about the plight of the protagonists; the reverse was true  I was more interested in seeing how the antagonists would succeed as the first half of the film was almost exclusively focused on why the Illuminati are who they are.  The film jumps from location to location with little explanation or reason and expects the viewer to believe that everybody in the movie is an ally when they first meet. Any analytical mind will realize this is highly improbable.  The climax is extremely cliché and leaves you asking what happened and wondering why nobody considered some of these points  it feels very tacked on and unnecessary.  The actors are not particularly believable in their roles  mostly because I found it difficult to believe that scientists  professors  and men of the church would act in the manner that they do without regard to the consequences of their actions. Events that happen are not plausible in the slightest and the pace of the movie is questionable with the characters jumping around while on a tight schedule and I had to question how the protagonists manage to get from location to location on time  every time.  The most pleasing part of the film is the cinematography  I found it a beautiful film to watch but it was such a mess  that I found it would not be worth paying to view in theatres.\n",

      "In a future where an industrious travel agency uses time travel technology to send wealthy clients back in time for explorations to the age of dinosaurs  the future is inexplicably changed when one of their clients breaks the cardinal rule not to stray off the path. In an attempt to fix the damage done  a seasoned time scout (Edward Burns) teams with the inventor of the technology (Catherine McCormack).  The premise is pretty good and engaging. It may have a few flaws in it but it could still make for an interesting movie. Unfortunately  A Sound of Thunder fails to really hook the audience in. It suffers from a number of problems and it takes itself way too seriously so it's hard to actually have any fun while watching the movie. Personally  I thought the script was the film's biggest problem. The were more plot holes than expected and the movie was kind of lazy in explaining things. I was hoping for a more in depth look into the butterfly effect but the film was more escapist fun than anything else. That's okay with me since 90 minutes of mindless fun is still a nice way to spend an evening. However  all the fun this film offered was unintentional and lame. There were a few scenes that kept me entertained but I was pretty bored.  The acting isn't much better since most of them seem more interested in a paycheck than anything else. The only person that gave a good performance was Ben Kingsley. He kept the first half of the film enjoyable and he seemed to be having the most fun as well. Edwards Burns was pretty pale and bland. I don't think he has what it takes to be a leading man. However  he could make for a decent supporting actor. Catherine McCormack was just really annoying and not very believable. I haven't really seen her in anything else but she could have potential. The rest of the actors also give bad performances though most of them are relatively unknown so it shouldn't effect their careers too much.  Looking at the message boards  most people are complaining about the special effects. There's no way to sugarcoat them and they are terrible. All the dinosaurs look really bad. The Gibbon-lizards (part monkey  part dino)  while a creative idea  become stale after awhile and they are most likely to encourage laughter rather than fear. The green screen work just looks awful and unprofessional. I was really wondering what director Peter Hyams was trying to accomplish here. He fails to deliver the suspense  action and thrills and makes this movie a long sit. For the most part though  the film is pretty harmless and it's far from the worst movie of 2005. Hopefully they will remake this film in the future. There is potential in this project but for now this is the best we got. In the end  unless curiosity gets the better of you  there is no reason to see A Sound of Thunder. Rating 4/10\n",

      "before seeing this film  the 1998 version was my only experience of this dickens story. i didn't enjoy that film very much  but this 1974 adaptation moves on in a particulary tiresome fashion.  the actors don't shine  the main couple michael york and sarah miles are especially wooden cases. the only character of real interest for me was anthony quayle's intelligent jaggers.  the so called plot is ridiculous  but the story itself is a great one. it's a real lesson on how your distorted values and obsessive principles can destroy you. live with an open mind and don't care what other people say  you are what you are  if others can't take it  **** 'em. pip was told this early on  but he didn't listen.  the girl adopted by the weird old lady reminded me a little of the old kaspar hauser story  not in that same horrible level  but in the way she molded the child to create the executor of her personal vendetta against the entire opposite sex she thought had deceived her. pip's childhood didn't appear much better. the ending didn't seem to fit the rest of the story's style. the sets looked cheap  and coming to imdb i'm not surprised to see that this was indeed a tv-movie (which i had no idea of when i borrowed it from the library).  live and learn. so many good movies  so little time. that's why the reviews are here. so YOU wouldn't have to waste your time on this sort of movies.  3/10\n",

      "There's something wonderful about a revenge film. Everyone wakes up in the morning believing he/she is the star of the movie  and that anyone who interferes with one's own personal agenda is in some way the enemy. Revenge plot films work particularly well if a person has low self-esteem. Rather than fighting back in the moment  the hero draws upon built-up inner anxiety to engage in a single act of power in an attempt to restore equilibrium. Quite naturally  in the real world this type of revenge seldom relieves the tension because life is not a movie; after the revenge is enacted the actions taken have their own consequences. A good revenge flick helps people ignore this bitter pill. In the movies the end credits roll and all responsibility resolved.  Swimming With Sharks is advertised as a comedy  no doubt an act on the part of the producers to figure out just how to sell this oddity. It's dark  but it isn't dark comedy (Company Of Men and the works of Todd Solondz come much closer). Parts of the film are so brutal they pre-date the current torture-porn genre everyone is so obsessed with (Saw  Hostel). There are some laughs. There are laughs in Saving Private Ryan too  but it isn't labeled comedy.  The intrinsic problem with this film is that it hasn't earned its revenge case. It is ostensibly about a young man who is abused by his boss and eventually takes his boss hostage to pay him back for all the mistreatment. The hero (aptly named Guy) is an everyman so vague we know literally nothing about him...what does he do with his spare time? Does he have friends/family? How did he get where he is? What are his interests (this becomes a running motif through the film  no doubt inspired by the film's author's own struggle...What do you want?  the answer to which we are denied by a vague  cheat of an ending)? It's very difficult to care for such a character  even if acted well (even Tom Hanks becomes a creep in the wrong roll  such as Punchline). Kevin Spacey as the boss  Buddy  is supposed to be a monster but he's too charismatic as an actor. The best laughs came when he abused his assistant--he seemed almost as surprised as the audience probably is at what Guy will endure. When Kevin's character is being tortured  the view taken suddenly becomes empathy for him. Guy is suddenly filmed as a leering monster without rationality. At this point any message the author had has been lost; there's no hero in this film  ergo  no reason to care at all.  It's not a stretch to assume this story is based on the author's own troubled career in the film business. I worked for a similar boss and can vouch that it's not that far-fetched. I had similar wish-fulfillment fantasies at that time and thought that I was justified. I thought you could win over the most beautiful woman in the story (actually  the ONLY woman--there seem to be all of about four people in the universe of this film) just by being your eager  naive self  that eagerness won accolades and that a boss abused you because he was a mean person. Time and tide have revealed the truth that most monsters are really just the demons of an individual's personal psyche and resentment is usually based in the self. As the film points out  if Guy was so unhappy he only had to leave. The film doesn't offer any denouement at all  surprise ending notwithstanding. We still know nothing about the protagonists  we can't even be sure anything they said was based in fact and everyone magically gets to have his cake and eat it too. In short  there was no point to this story at all other than to point out that (shock!) the film business can be pretty brutal.  There are plenty of good films that tell solid and satisfying revenge-style fantasies  both the feel-good variety (9-to5  Working Girl  The Devil Wears Prada) and not so much (War Of The Roses  the remake of The Hills Have Eyes). This isn't one of them--despite a fun turn by Benicio Del Toro in the Emily Blunt role from Prada and some interesting work by Spacey and Michelle Forbes  this is a frustrating  mean  confused and slightly dull creation of self- indulgence from a director who has  one hopes  worked it all out by now...\n",

      "This is one of those films that you watch with a group of people. You will have the best time. It's really  really bad  like Showgirls bad but without the quality of Showgirls.  You've got the best mix of bad actors  bad director and bad script here. Everything that can possible be wrong that can make for an entertaining evening  you have here. The first being the tag line is a bunch of teenagers... These people are as much teenagers as my grandmother.  The director has zero sense of suspense or tension. The 30 year old teenagers are standing around and the monster comes out and attacks and this pretty much happens throughout the movie when the monsters are revealed. There is no suspense building up to this or surprise or anything. It's more like when you were kids pretending to be chased by monsters and just kind of made up stuff as you went. And when I use the word monsters I exaggerate. More like a couple guys in Halloween masks bought at the .99 cent store.  There is no doubt this script was spun off in a couple days  no rewrites and I can only imagine how bad and poorly formatted it looked on the page because it was clearly written by an amateur with no clue. It's another example of one of the bad things about this day and age: anyone can make a movie.  But of course the best bad thing about this film is the acting. It's as bad as you can get. There isn't one person in this who has the slightest skill at acting and the lead is the absolute worst. He delivers every line in this monotone manner without any expression and you have to wonder how someone this bad could possible get a part in any movie  no matter who he knows. When he had to cry when his girlfriend was killed  it was one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in a movie. Watching these people reciting some of the awful dialog is very very funny. But when the black guy said tell her...tell her...I love her... before his death scene  there was a huge laugh among our group. Funny  funny stuff.  My only hope is this movie gets bad enough ratings to take its place where it belongs: in the IMDb lowest rating 100 movies. We can do it  folks!  PS. Is it any surprise that the one great comment this movie got in here was from someone in Virginia (who has one comment  only on this movie and nothing else). And guess where the movie was made? Virginia. I've said it before and I'll say it again: people who work on the movie should NOT be allowed to comment on it.\n",

Some purely evil character does some dastardly deed  Walker goes after him  and it ends in a Karate match.

      "Greedy land baron in the tiny western town of Prairie City wants all the ranchers off their land  using intimidation tactics and arson to get them to vacate; seems the town is swimming atop oil  and when a Swedish farmer refuses to leave  he's mowed down by the baron's hired gun. The farmer's seafaring son soon arrives  slowly realizing what he's up against and attempting to rally the rest of the residents to fight. Another lawlessness-in-the-West story  with everybody under the thumb of the villain (who naturally holds all the cards). Derivative and uncomfortable at times to watch  with a long wait before our stoic hero finally gets his dander up. Sterling Hayden's half-hearted Swedish accent is a big problem  though he cuts a sturdy  sympathetic presence on the screen and almost makes the picture worth-watching. Director Joseph H. Lewis stages most of the scenes stiffly  like a TV western  and Gerald Fried's bugle-heavy score is no help  though the rich black-and-white cinematography by Ray Rennahan is excellent. An independent production released via United Artists  the film has a bizarre start (beginning with shots from the finale  followed by shots from the movie's midsection)  yet it does have a certain needling power which most assuredly gets the viewer on Hayden's side. ** from ****\n",

      "OK  first off there may be a SPOILER here since i don't know what constitutes giving out too much information. My subject line says it all but surely people will want to know WHY it's so stupid.  First off  this film follows a bunch of Yuppies as they go to a sports game in Chicago but wind up taking the wrong exit and winding up in the ghetto. Scary  huh? Well  first of all  Emilio is driving everyone in the world's most overblown RV/Winnebago  tricked out with satellite dishes and crap like that on it. So these guys are GOING to a sports game (i forget which  though likely the Bulls or the White Sox since they're near the oh-so-scary ghetto)  yet they can't even make it down the freeway without having an onboard viewing command center that would put ESPN to shame. Yet they're smart enough to earn livings that would pay for the stuff  but are such sports fans that they don't even know which exit to get off at on their way to the game they so love.  I gave up on the movie within a half hour after that  but the reasons were plentiful. They wind up IN THE GHETTO  yet their main danger to their existence is DENIS LEARY. A WHITE GUY. I'm no racist  but COME ON. In anything RESEMBLING reality - and this film WAS trying to be an urban nightmare - Denis Leary would not be trying to kill Emilio Estevez  he'd be hitching a ride to get the f*** out of Dodge himself!!!  This is easily one of the dumbest movies ever created  although I'm not familiar with much of the rest of the world's cinema.

      "The title for this review about sums up how I feel about this movie. I can't imagine what audience there would be for this thing  if not for the die-hard fan of 1980s slasher films who simply has to see -everything- from that era. Otherwise  don't even waste your time on this.  The story is similar to most films of its type: something awful happens to one of the characters in the opening scene  which inspires a bloodthirsty killer to go on a murderous rampage. Been there  done that. Truth be told  none of these '80s slashers were known for their originality  so I can't see the point in harping on the film simply for this.  But where the film fails is in its suspense and murder sequences. I've seen some pretty scary slasher movies from the 1980s that had far lower budgets than this. This one just fails to create any real suspense. The director throws in some nice camera angles and some semi-professional directorial touches here and there  but they mean nothing if you're not frightened. The gore is pretty tame as well  so anyone who watches these things with the intention of seeing some cool 1980s makeup effects will be sadly disappointed.  The movie manages to clunk along rather dully. Honestly  the key ingredient to almost any slasher is the tight pacing--you have to keep things moving along swiftly and keep the murder set pieces staged at regular intervals  because  let's face it  we don't watch these things for the great characterization and stellar plots. But the pacing  whether due to the script or the editor  is all off. The murders are spaced out at odd intervals  leaving us with some long-winded scenes (no doubt meant to build character) that serve only to bore you and leave you praying for the next kill (which  as I've said  usually isn't executed all that well anyway).  As for the killer  don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening. He (or she?) wears a jogging suit  a fencing mask  and his (or her?) primary weapon is a sword. I bet the writer just wet himself over thinking he came up with an original  cool murder weapon  but the idea just comes off as impractical and silly. There's also not much emphasis placed on the whodunnit' nature of the film  as if they either forgot or don't care to place any red herrings in the mix to throw us off.  I have the sense that the people behind this were trying to make something decent and respectable  and at times  it shows their intentions were probably a bit more genuine in regards to making a quality film as opposed to countless other knockoff slashers from the era. But alas  the attempt fails for the most part. There is  however  some pretty good acting (at least  for this type of film). There is attempt at characterization  but none of it ends up meaning anything in the end  so...what a waste. Here  all it manages to do is bog down the plot and make the murder sequences feel like they can't come soon enough.  In the end  if you're really into these old '80s slashers  by all means  check it out  if only to say you've seen it. There's a completest in all of us. But don't expect to be blown away or anything. What we have here is a very mildly entertaining slasher movie that leaves no real impression at all.\n",

Further  even though this is a business arrangement  the first time she's with her sperm donor  she takes off all her clothes  as if it's a seduction. Plus  her husband doesn't notice when $30 000 goes missing from their bank accounts. Does all this seem to demand more willing suspension of disbelief than even most Hollywood fare? Far fetched on all counts.\n",

      "For connoisseurs of bad movies  Galaxina is a true gem. With truly horrid dialog  acting  and directing  it's no choice for people seeking a proper movie. But as one of the most unintentionally hilarious movies of its genre  it's priceless for a good laugh. In particular  the scenes involving the Harley Davidson-worshiping motorcycle cult are especially good  and many other scenes present an opportunity for a cheap laugh.  Sadly  the scenes with Dorothy Stratten really fail to deliver  but since she's playing an android  I suppose one can excuse her for wooden acting.  Bad movie-lovers  don't pass this one up!\n",

      "This movie was made because the concept translates well into a two sentence summary that can be used to lure investors. That is  the premise is interesting and sellable. I mean  I rented it based on the synopsis. The problem is there is nothing beyond the initial concept. There is no coherent plot  no fully fledged characters  no real comedy  no interesting scenery  no surprises  and no good performances (except Jon Herder  he does something with very little). It's as if the people who green lit this thing never read the script but only the synopsis. And if there were enough people like me  it may even have made money.  To the prospective viewer: don't waste your time  there is nothing funny or interesting to see here. To the creators of the film: hey  you got your film made  so what if its not that great.

      "I went to see Quitting with high hopes  because the director's Shower had impressed me so. Despite a few lapses into mawkishness  Shower ranks high on my list of all-time favorite movies for its penetrating insight into family relationships and its generally superb acting and direction. And I've seen it at least three times now.  But Quitting fell flat  in my estimation. It seemed a pointless exercise and I was quickly so tired of the main character's insufferable personality that I was longing for the movie to end. I admit to falling asleep six or seven times  but it was only for a few seconds at a time  so I think it's still OK to write this comment.  I did admire the parents and sister. The device of using all real characters in the film is a nice one I've never seen used before.  Disappointment aside  I will still make an effort to see any film bearing Yang Zhang's name  simply on the basis of the beautiful Shower.\n",

      "This turned out to be more of a women's romance-soap-suspense film than what I hoped it was....simply a tense thriller. Yes  the final 20 minutes were suspenseful but much of the previous 75 bordered on being just plain tedious.  Ruter Hauer was a little too subdued  not playing his normal intense character. Natasha Richardson sports somewhat of a dumb look most of the time and her character was very unappealing.  The story is so-so. It's not as bad as I'm making out  but it sure isn't anything I'd watch again  and the back of the VHS describing this movie was misleading.\n",

      "This movie was terrible. John Wayne is a brutal actor at times. The lead female playing the role of Maura did a good job and tried her best to make scenes believable despite Wayne's inept  one dimensional  over acting. Seriously  did you see him when he was supposed to be talking in his sleep? Ridiculous. And his character became such an awful person in the second half of the movie and then did nothing to atone for his behavior and is still forgiven by everyone including his arch nemesis without even so much as a 'sorry'. The story was completely implausible. We were supposed to believe that two grown men  both tremendous successes in their respected fields  would sabotage a job and risk the lives of innocent men simply because they disliked one another? YOu can pretty much randomly select any scene and it will probably leave you shaking your head in disbelief that someone paid money to have this film made. Its too bad because the only other Wayne films I've seen are the shootist and rio bravo  which were both great movies. Unless you're being paid don't bother watching this one.\n",

      "Having been a Godzilla fan for many years  Gamera was to me a cheap knockoff to capitalize on the success of Toho's #1 kaiju star. ATTACK OF THE MONSTERS was for me at the time (1975) an almost painful viewing experience.  Last weekend  I attended the annual Godzilla fest  known as G-FEST  where Carl Craig  one of the stars of GAMERA vs. VIRAS  made an appearance. Of course  they featured this movie. It was one of the most hilarious bad movies ever made. Of course  you have to be in the right frame of mind to watch it. In one scene  for example  the boy scouts held prisoner on board the alien space craft manage to escape by distracting the not-too-bright aliens. When they realize theyve been duped  one of them says  That's funny...I think those kids lied to us. Not even PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE can boast that kind of dialog.  This may not be GODZILLA or even GAMERA 3  but this one is a decent enough time waster  if you watch it in the right frame of mind.

      "The fifth collaboration between Marlene Dietrich and director Josef von Sternberg  BLONDE VENUS is a film that looks great while it's playing but fails to engages the viewer. The plodding storyline of Dietrich being torn between two men  becoming a mammoth cabaret star  and fighting for the custody of her child is jumbled and often feels like bits of three separate films half-baked together. Dietrich is unwisely cast in a rather passive  reactive role for much of the film and her character remains aloof from viewers  while Herbert Marshal is unconvincing as her ill-tempered husband  and Cary Grant is largely wasted as a suave suitor who dashes in and out of the picture. The film does contain some intriguing set pieces (the Hot Voodoo number is the high point) that are impressively surrealistic for this era in Hollywood  although it proves to no avail in such a dull  incoherent film.\n",

      "The satirical movie website Dateline Hollywood joked that Son of the Mask was all a practical joke star Jamie Kennedy played on New Line Cinema for his show The Jamie Kennedy Experiment. If only. And if only the movie had been half as funny as that satire piece.  The Mask was the ideal vehicle for the face-pulling Jim Carrey that so many viewers dote on; it also delighted males over the age of 12 by introducing Cameron Diaz. So having a followup minus both of them was not a good idea  plus you'd have thought New Line would have learned their lesson after Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd. But no... though to be fair  having an all new cast is in keeping with the original comic (in which the Mask went from owner to owner). As written by Lance Khazei and directed by Lawrence Guterman  however  there's nothing there in return  except a steady stream of admittedly decent FX by the usual squadron of houses (Industrial Light and Magic improving on the Ally McBeal dancing baby and their own Baby's Day Out  with the Tippett Studio  Giant Killer Robots  Digital Dimension and so on in support) and an even greater pandering to cartoon fans by having our hero work at an animation company (responsible for such gems as Siamese Popes)  naming his character after Tex Avery  and working in not just references to classic cartoons but actual clips.  The trouble is that last approach doesn't really work  partly because most of the attempts to bring cartoon trappings to live action fall flat (especially the cars getting in the party mood) and mostly because the tributes to the Flintstones  Woody Woodpecker  Duck Amuck and especially One Froggy Evening show up how weak this movie is in comparison. Plus the movie fits in shambolic slapstick alongside strained sentiment (the underlying theme of the story is family; our hero isn't ready to have a son  and his nemesis - Alan Cumming as the Norse god Loki - is far from the apple of Odin's eye... and what Bob Hoskins is doing here as Odin  even after Super Mario Bros.  is beyond me)  and Kennedy just isn't in the same league as Carrey in the zany stakes - though it's not like he gets any help from the script. Also note that unlike Diaz  the very cute Traylor Howard (as the mother of the son of the Mask) doesn't get much to do; giving HER the Mask might have helped the movie.  Further points are lost for throwing away Cumming  Hoskins  Steven Wright and Magda Szubanski; for a suspiciously abbreviated running time (which would account for some gaping plot holes and scenes that seem to be missing); and for an incredibly bad attempt at an inside joke when our hero fails to sell the concept of the green guy as an animated TV series - The Mask did become an animated TV series in real life  and was a far better follow up than this sequel. The fact that this actually opened in Britain before the US should tell you everything... what with this and Blade: Trinity  New Line seems intent on cornering the market on dreadful sequels with cast members from Two Guys And A Girl. What next  The Butterfly Effect 2 with Nathan Fillion?  Somebody stop this.\n",

      "This movie had an excellent premise  and could have been a fascinating look at racism  attitudes to women at work and male female relations in England early last century. However  it simply turned into a soppy love story. But what was worse  is that the love story was totally unbelievable. The acting was for the most part poor  the direction confusing  but most of all the screenplay and the story were non-existent. The only thing I liked about the film was how dark it must have been before electric lighting. I really got a sense of just how little light one candle puts out.\n",

      "This film looks great  and that's about where my praise ends. Love Is a Many Splendored Thing came out in the very schizophrenic year of 1955  when candy-coloured nonsense like this co-existed with trail-blazing artistic fair like Kiss Me Deadly. As a trend toward smaller  socially conscious films like On the Waterfront and Marty established itself in the mid-50's  other directors felt the need to stick with the unchallenging  pandering melodrama that classifies so many other films from that decade  and Love is one of the latter.  This is the kind of 50's movie where the Technicolor is used to its garish utmost and the lighting is invariably high-key; even scenes taking place in a dark room or at night are brighter than the average sunny day. I never want to hear the theme song again  as it's played frequently enough over the course of the film to last anyone a lifetime  and I certainly don't want to hear it sung by the shrill  ear-piercing choir that belts it out over the end titles. Jennifer Jones and William Holden are passable  but really anybody could have played these parts. Jones' role is horribly written--her character is incredibly inconsistent  and it seems as if whenever her character is required to make a decision about something  the screenwriters flipped a coin to decide what that decision would be.  People will undoubtedly tell me I'm taking this film too seriously  that I'm unromantic  etc. But I loved All That Heaven Allows  released the same year and just as cornball in its own way  except that Douglas Sirk is able to turn melodrama into an art form  whereas Henry King (director of Love) is not.  I'm usually able to enjoy bad melodrama  but in this case I was just bored.  Grade: D+\n",

      "Well Wright may have made a gritty depiction of life around 1800 - as he so repeatedly and anally goes on about because of when it was written as opposed to published - but it is HIS not Austen's and shouldn't claim to be an adaptation.  Mrs Bennett looks like a rural washerwoman. This is a pampered woman - they have servants (remember the book scene with the servant dressing the hair  etc)? But Wright portrays her with rough reddened skin all down her chest  rough hands and working in the kitchen. And the pigs wandering through! If he wants bucolic  he should try Tess.  Mr Bennett - the script makes too cuddly and modern and ignored the weakness in him. The scene where he stops Mary playing is supposed to make you cringe - not pass in seconds. If it doesn't - don't include it.  MacFadyen is very weak in the part and seems to be doing some kind of Pride by numbers acting. The first proposal he looks like a nervous schoolboy rather than a man overcoming his pride to make a proposal beneath his station. Most of his lines  he could as well be reading a shopping list.  Lydia is awful. Completely over the top with excessive shrieking and skipping. Indeed  Knightley plays Elizabeth more like the giggling inane character Lydia actually is in the book  at times.  And Elizabeth. Half the time Knightley is  clearly  mimicking Ehle's voice and intonation - close your eyes to see what a copy it is. And in her role you see Wright's major error - there is NO PREJUDICE.  From the first encounter with Darcy she clearly fancies him. When he comments to Bingley on the attractiveness of the women in the hall she initially looks hurt - not shocked and affronted. The latter should set up the prejudice side of things. And when she and 'caroline' are prancing round the room she comes across like a tease  obviously all over him. And by virtually cutting out Wickham you don't get Elizabeth invested enough there to set up the prejudicial aspects falling out of that relationship.  And apparently it is Caroline not Miss Bingley. And Mr Bingley happily wanders into Jane's bedroom. And and and - Wright can boast about how great he is with period all he wants. But a few panorama shots of rural life (which show the preference for Hardy) don't excuse him the glaring blunders all over the place.  The cinematographer - who clearly wants awards - should have been reined in. He veered between Bronte and Hardy throughout the film - and wasn't the last proposal shots/lighting from Tess? The need to see Darcy walk along through the 'scape with unkempt shirt was just dumb. But most importantly - when going between those 2 very different landscapes they forget the most important one - Austen. (She'd have laughed out loud at the Elizabeth = sad  therefore = rain  running through to picturesque folly  wet Darcy rubbish).  I admit I found it impossible the watch the film without using the book as context. I was prepared to give it some leeway as it had to provide the story in a short space of time. But to forget fully one half of the core of the book in prejudice and Darcy to continually look more constipated than prideful  made it almost unwatchable. I could only see it as a mess with generally poor performances (when Knightley wasn't aping Ehle she was gurning or skipping or both and only calmed down a couple of times to indicate she does have some promise - but faffing about on swings to convey emotion isn't a substitute for a poor script and poor direction) - although for some it was simply a case of bad script.  Tom Holland alone would escape censure. While he toned down the comic aspects of Collins  he did turn in a very interesting approach. Dench does superbly the schtick she can do in her sleep whether it be here or in Oscar Wilde - but this was supposed to be Lady Catherine De Bourgh NOT Lady Bracknell. She was just a little too sane.  The shortened length could have been handled by a competent screenwriter  surely? Not characters filling in story gaps and helping along the audience all over the place. Elizabeth couldn't have come up with the £10k figure. And while they wanted to cut time with her learning of Darcy's involvement in Wickhams marriage the lines didn't fit with Lydia. It was the worst case of incongruous exposition in the piece.  It really is appalling stuff. Anyone who reviews it saying it works well in the context of the book is someone I frankly don't believe has read or understood the characterisations in the thing. Wright seems to think his characters are in the 1990s not the 1709s from their behaviour. I'm not convinced he has read the book - he certainly doesn't understand it. He doesn't understand Austen's acerbic wit or lightness of touch - he certainly made a dull plodding film out of it.  What is possibly worse was the sad pathetic need of the chick lit lovers to need the 'I love you  I love yous' all over the place so they can sigh and get off on it. The fact that it has no place in a work by Austen is apparently irrelevant.  Anyone who reviews it as a film alone? Well  more difficult for me except I would note the poor acting  the weak Darcy  and the gurning skipping inane irritation of the whole thing. If you are going to adapt you can change a lot - but if it loses the spirit and key motivations  then don't insult the book by taking it's title.\n",

      "I happened to have seen this movie this morning on TCM. Very bad acting  low budget and poor plot are the impressions I felt while watching the movie. The only highlight of the movie was watching tender young Rita Moreno  (23 years old)  playing a teenage Indian squaw in love with an older man in his 50's. She reminded me of a earlier version of Sue Lyon as Lolita (1962)  only a more innocent Lolita. She bounces up and down like a 1950's teeny bopper  almost as if you would expect her to be chewing gum  falling all over this old man  willing to give him anything  as he plays it off like she's a hindrance to him. Any man in his 50's that had a beautiful  virgin  teenage girl willing to do ANYTHING for him and be his bride  would be insane not to take advantage of her. It's too bad that the censorship board back when this movie was released didn't permit more of an expansion of a character such as Rita Moreno's. The only reason why I gave this movie a 3 instead of a 1 is Rita Moreno's appearance in the movie.\n",

      "Through its 2-hour running length  Crash charts the emotional anguish of its 10-odd ensemble of characters when faced with the sometimes blatant and sometimes latent forms of racism underlying in American society. That and the emotional anguish of one of its audiences sitting near the front and desperately trying to make sense of what movies have become these days.  The era we live in has become so complicated. Not only do we reject modernism  even the not very enthusiastic flag-waving of post-modernism ideas is always being shot down by what  post-post-modernism that aims to destroy all these ideas  all in no part thanks to the great destructivist ideas of those great 'thinkers'. But I digress. This has nothing much to do with the what the movie is about  but rather what the movie is.  Sure  it seems hard to earn a living in a Hollywood that has to cater to a market that is so post-post-post everything that cynicism has become more than just a motto in life. It has become part of everything we do and part of everything we think of whether we like it or not. And so a new studio product is born! Indie films  which once were energetic and idealistic in its defiant experimentalism now seem to be as equally adamant as Hollywood films to sell to indie film markets. An indie film must sell at Sundance before becoming 'acclaimed'. And so nothing is simple anymore. Even what constitutes a good film becomes so murky. Whereas in the past filmmakers just wanted to entertain people and tell a good story--and in these seemingly simplistic attempts the greatest of films are borne--filmmakers nowadays have to make films that are good first and foremost; films have to make people think  have to be meaningful  has to be provocative  raise questions  yadda yadda yadda. What it all boils down to  is a subversion of the Hollywood movie system  but this subversion seems strangely similar to the formulaic similarity of Hollywood films  the countless ways of differing to essentially be the same product.  And I haven't even begun on the film yet. Maybe I've become too picky on films I see these days. Maybe it's because of my primary need to be entertained  rather than  say  be probed when seeing a movie. But hell  this movie is one big load of crap. And I'm repulsed by this movie not just because it follows the How to Make a Good Movie Good 101 guidebook to the T--characters spout eloquent lines and are sooo witty like they're gifted with the speech of God; it raises issues about racism and life confronting racism in America; it has 'touching' moments where everyone discovers more about themselves and more about other people; not to mention the fact that once you hear the ambient/new age soundtrack of women singing in high registers in foreign languages  you know you're in for all of the above traits.  And something about the aforementioned point--about it raising questions about immediately-compelling issues like racism--pisses me off big time. Like all post-post-post-post-post everything movies  it doesn't contend with just having a message about this issue. Because oh  our audiences are much to intelligent for that these days in this post-post-post-post world. Our audiences want us to make them think  doesn't want us to put things so simplistically  (and then they will go into existentialist crap and say) that's because life itself isn't simplistic. Ha ha ha. What other common drill do we here then the audience need to think about issues rather than have them fed to them. Okay  okay  and okay. So the film makes it a point to pound the audiences with these non-messages and since they're not exactly a message  it's so decidedly subtle and subtle means good right? So we're being hit again and again with this well-written subtlety with the eloquence of rhetorical prose. And as if the irony is not steep enough  we have Ludicrous' character  the only character who seems to not take all these racism discussion bullshit seriously  being 'converted' into one of those irritatingly meaningful characters where he learns something in the end  giving meaningful looks and pauses where audiences are supposed to 'learn something about themselves too'. Um  yeah. How I wanted to see an incredibly racist film right after this man.  To cut the long bullshit short  I guess I wouldn't have taken issue with the film if it wasn't so bloated in its self-importance. The angst that forms the entire movie felt more like white-boy whining than actual Spike Lee-ish anger. It's so Tim Robbins and Sean Penn  the type that wants to wave flags about humanitarianism when the only thing they don't realize is the flag they're waving is their hole-ridden underwear. Plus it's become so trendy in the post-post-post-post world to be completely subtle about it. Nothing is simple any longer. In its best efforts to actually be good  provocative  and ultimately human  it's become neither  imho  just another indie crap from an indie director that wants to make a name out of himself as a credible indie-filmmaker. Now at least Hollywood is more simple and sincere in its manipulativeness.\n",

Seemed like a good old action movie  so I took out the chips and coke and was ready for a relaxing evening. Well  the pain started right from the beginning. The main character is a boxer who is the nicest guy I have ever seen. As the good person he has to be nice of course  but he is just a pussy! That totally doesn't fit with a boxer that has 28 KO's and starts working for a pimp to earn some extra money. Even nice guys can still be cool. Well  then came his first fight while he was working for this pimp. Every punch was clearly missed and that became even more annoying because the sound effect weren't synchronised with the punches. Then there is this totally worthless acting of the whole cast  and you have enough reasons to leave this movie for what it is. I gave it a 1 because I have never seen such a bad movie.\n",

      "This is an excellent example of an entreatingly bad b-movie. There are worse movies than this one (Titanic for example)  but this definitely shares the pile of steaming crap movies.  OK this was apparently shot in Kansas City  which explains why everyone is so lame. The main guy looks like Steve Guttenberg  and is even more lame than him! I didn't even think that was possible! In fact  him and the main girl in the movie are responsible for the WORST DRAMA EVER! Its not just that there acting was waaaaaaaaay over-dramatic  well actually it was  of course the script was terrible which combines for a deadly one-two punch in bad terrible utterly unwatchable drama.  The scarecrow  lets talk about him. The whistling you hear every time he's around is stupid  and obviously dubbed in. Now his costume  I cannot get over that - its a guy wearing burlap sacks and a stupid mask! I simply am dumbfounded  maybe if your 3 years old with brain damage you'd be scared of him/it.  One of the characters  the token black guy actually  used the line: This might be a chance to earn my red wings when referring to trying to score with one of the girls on her period. Wow  um yea  that is the kind of dialogue you can look forward to.  Oh  in the beginning when the scantily clad girl is running through the corn  why is it roped off? I'm pretty sure its not supposed to be evident  just one of the many obvious mistakes made throughout this 'film' Another is the bad dubbing for the musical number (yup thats right)  there all at the beach  and the one dorkaziod gets up the courage to sing a song and play guitar for everyone  and its so obviously dubbed its funny. Thankfully  the scarecrow answers all our prayers and throws a spear right through the guy's chest when he's done singing. Overall the gore like that is pretty good  this is one of those films when you rooting for these people to be killed by the killer.  OK  there's a scene where the 2 guys bury one of their friends in the sand  then stand up  whip out their peni  and urinate all over the guy in the sand. Who does this? Really  imagine it Hey  lets bury joe in the sand  then stand up and take out our genitals like its no big deal and pee on him In fact  this brings up the homo-eroticism in this film  what the hell? A good part of the beginning of this movie is the jocks standing around in there underwear in the locker room and corn field while there doing the hazing. What the hell is with that? Traditionally  in film and real life  jocks get the girls and nerds don't. That really doesn't make sense as all nerds think of is girls and sex  and apparently all jocks think of is sports and being around each other in their underwear  I don't get it.  Lets get to the sex. As someone who watched this movie with me put it: I've never been so disgusted by heterosexual sex in my life and its true. If you like hot A cup action  or ugly old woman boobs  then this film is for you. I swear  they found a girl with the smallest breasts ever and this is who they get to do the nude scene?? Then the ugly old woman nurse shows her bouncy ones a couple of times  and man  I just didn't want to see that.  Now  I have to talk about the timeline continuity to this film  thats what really is just bizarre. It starts in the daytime  then they all head to the cornfield  and within like 2 minutes its instantly dark middle of the night  when they drive off from there saying their going to the beach - its instantly day again  and apparently they stay at the beach until night again  and until day the next day. SO basically these events in the film cover 4 days  without any of the characters needing sleep or anything  its really weird.  After the main killings have taken place  it flash forwards to '3 weeks later' and apparently none of these people actually care that they saw their friends brutally murdered! The surviving people literally pop some champaign! And thats when I realized the budget didn't go to the script  directing or acting  it all went to that freakin bottle of champaign.  The ending. Stop reading now if you don't want the ending spoiled for you  it truly is enjoyable.  OK  so the end takes place in a church  and the scarecrow put his soul inside the diabetes kid body  then he fights with the steve guttenberg lookalike guy  and he fights him with a b-movie version of the power the emperor had in star wars! I'm not kidding  its so stupid! So somehow  in the middle of the fight  the scarecrow's soul jumps bodies into the guttenberg jr. guy  and then with the last amount of will he has of his own  he impales himself on a cross in the church! Its awesome! Some blood  but whats even better is that the cross is obviously cardboard! You can see the bottom move off the ground! Wow  yea have fun watching.\n",

      "Can I just start by saying I'm a fan of bad movies. And this is a really bad movie. It states on the front 100 passengers  3000 snakes  but I think it's more accurate to say 12 passengers and about 20 snakes.  The snakes don't do anything particularly interesting  the whole movie in fact just blunders on with little happening. Although there is occasionally a great gore shot of pulsating arms and green goo puke (bad movies have to have green goo don't they?).  But then the ending comes along and will quite literally smack you off you seat in hysteria. and for that  this movie gets a boost up to a 2* rating.  There are certain movies about in the world that you will want to show to your friends  just so you can watch there reaction when a certain event happens in them.  For example The arrival of 'Big Man' in R Kelly's 'trapped in the closet' 'The LINE' in 'Shark Attack 3' (you'll know it when you hear it) The arrival of the mama shark in 'Shark Attack 3' Almost every scene of 'troll 2' The ending of 'Dracula 3000' (just for utter disbelief and confusion) and the end of this movie proudly sits in this category. It's worth sitting through just for that. So get drunk  stoned  whatever your poison is and watch this movie with some mates.  Quite simply  if you like bad movies  get this  but don't get it confused with 'Snakes on a plane' ... there's no relation.  And don't pay more than a fiver for it either ....\n",

      "Alright  so not every Australian movie is all that good. Yes  maybe there have actually been very few with much merit. Take Away however is an absolute bomb  qualifying as one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I wanted to like it. I figured I'd give it a fair go. I've even met one of the screen writers Dave O'neil so I feel kind of a traitor giving this movie a bad review  but... The plot is fairly thin (I won't bother relating it... read the synopsis)  which I can forgive: there are plenty of movies that can cover that up with a few decent jokes. Unfortunately  Take Away's jokes cover its plot up like a $2 prostitute's skirt. Probably the only laughs that came from the 6 other people in the cinema was at the poor acting and dialogue. Take Away goes down like a week old Dim sim ... You might understand that joke if you see the film but the joke's not worth it.\n",

      "I vowed some time ago to never get another Joe Castro film (perhaps after Near Death) but I sort of ended up with this one by accident  since it was a Troma release & I didn't read the cover carefully. Oops. Well  I watched it  and it's by no means good  but it's  I guess  sort of tongue in cheek....if it's not  it sure seemed that way. Some intrepid folks from the University of the Rio Grande set out to find if the Chupacabra exists  because of surveillance camera footage from someone's GOAT BARN that shows this weird thing hopping across the field of vision. And also because the person that this thing supposedly killed was the uncle of the leader of the expedition. There's a couple of camera men  one of whom whines the whole time  and there some ex-Marine named Army (?!)  who is some kind of munitions expert or something. At any rate  the do find the Chupacabra on some guy's ranch & set out to find it  getting involved with two supposed witches along the way. The creature itself is rather ridiculous-looking  with spines on its back & a great big long tongue that Gene Simmons would die for. Eventually  after a bunch of folks done get killed  so does the Chupacabra  and they take it back to the university for an autopsy. So  is it from another planet? Is it a genetic creation from some lab in Puerto Rico? Uh  they don't tell us  really. Not exactly intriguing but not quite terrible either. Definitely not a wide audience for this one. 4 out of 10.\n",

      "Bone Eater is set in a small desert town in Alabama where property developer Dick Krantz (Jim Storm) is financing the building of a huge resort. Late one night three of his workers Riley (Timothy Starks)  Hansen (Adrian Alvarado) & Miller (Paul Rae) are digging foundations in the desert when they unearth what looks like a tomahawk axe  unfortunately for them an ancient Native American demon called the bone eater comes along & kills them. Local Sheriff Steve Evans (Bruce Boxleitner) soon has Krantz breathing down his neck as the construction of his resort grinds to a halt  Sheriff Evans also has to deal with the bone eater demon as it kills anyone it comes across...  You know I consider myself a fairly big fan of the horror & sci-fi genre  I certainly don't think my opinion is worth more than anyone else's (unlike many here on the IMDb...) but please believe me when I say that Bone Eater is the worst Sci-Fi Channel 'Creature Feature' I have ever seen & it's up against some damned strong competition. As a horror & sci-fi fan there are two names that when involved with a film send shudders down my spine in anticipation of how bad it will turn out  those names are Jesus 'I have no talent' Franco who had nothing to do with Bone Eater & Jim Wynorski who directed the absolute disaster that is Bone Eater. In fact Bone Eater is so bad Wynorski hid under the pseudonym Bob Robertson  when a director as bad as Wynorski hides under a pseudonym you know the film must be bad. Where do I even start? Bone Eater is quite simply the worst film I have seen this year & is so bad it's untrue  the story is awful  the script is sloppy (at one point Sheriff Evans tells Kia to meet him at the hospital but when they meet there later he acts surprised & says 'what are you doing here?'  at one point Sheriff Evans triumphantly claims that we are in the twentieth century & that ancient Native American demons are nonsense although actually we are in the twenty first century now  there's a part when a woman tells in flashback the story where three men awaken the Bone Eater & it kills them but since it killed all three of them how did anyone else know about it for it to be passed down in legend?) & at times it gets more than a little bit embarrassing. The character's are horrible clichés  the small town Sheriff who saves the day  his daughter becomes involved which adds some personal motivation & as for the Native Americans there's an old wise man  a young hot head who hates 'white man' & a young woman who is the voice of reason between the two who have names like Storm Cloud & Black Hawk. The film is as boring as hell  nothing happens  the story is awful  it's full of plot holes & lapses in any sort of logic  the set-pieces are terrible  there's no horror or gore or suspense or mystery & Bone Eater is just the sort of film that makes you lose the will to live.  Bone Eater has some of the worst CGI computer effects I've seen in a while  from the daft looking stiff moving bone eater creature itself which is just a selection of bones magically held together to a motorbike jumping a large gap to an awful CGI truck crashing over the edge of a cliff to a van being tossed to one side by the bone eater. Whenever the bone eater needs to get some speed up he causes a large horse to form from the sand & dust & rides it! In principal this is actually quite a neat idea but it looks awful & the scenes even have cheesy cowboy music on the soundtrack! There is one pointless scene at the end when Sheriff Evans cuts his own arm (why?) & it bleeds but apart from that there isn't a single drop of blood in the thing  whenever the bone eater kills someone they usually just disappear in a cloud of dust  boring. The hilariously goofy climatic showdown between Sheriff Evans & the bone eater has to be seen to be believed  Sheriff Evans goes native on horseback complete with tribal war paint on his face while the bone eater also rides his dust horse & they have a sort of jousting contest which is just to bad to describe properly.  With a supposed budget of about $700 000 Bone Eater is filmed in a very bland  forgettable & flat way  there's no sense of style here at all. The majority of the film takes place in bright sunlight & if you watch it on a decent telly then the desert scenery is quite nice on occasion. There are several veteran 'known' actors really slumming it here  Boxleitner plays exactly the same role as in the similarly themed but much better 'Creature Feature' Snakehead Terror (2004)  William Katt will obviously put his name to any crap as long as he gets paid while ex Star Trek man Walter Koenig must be really desperate to agree to appear in this.  Bone Eater is a truly atrocious 'Creature Feature'  there's really not much more you can say about it other than to steer well clear of it. The worst film ever to appear on the Sci-Fi Channel & that's saying something  isn't it?\n",

      "One of the commenter's is wrong. This is not the only Pat Patterson film and he didn't die two years after this was made. He shot a film called the Electric Chair in Pineville  NC. He shot this a few years after Doctor Gore. Patterson died in the late 70's. I know this because he used my house and he left a cat there!! It sucked also. This was a big deal when the movie came out. No independent horror films were being made in NC. This movie didn't help matters. Patterson used to do gore effects for H. G. Lewis. He was also good at magic. His gore scenes in Body shop were actually well done. The film was shot in a building that also housed a 7/11. You can actually see the tops of the walls in some scenes. The budget was less that $20 000 and the script looked like a child wrote it. Only Patterson could understand it. Still...it's entertainment and it's a classic.\n",

      "Saw this last night and being a fan of the first Demons  I had hoped that the sequel would have the same fun  spooky spirit of it's predecessor. This is unfortunately not the case. The set-up is similar as the first  in which a horde of flesh-eating demons burst forth into reality by being released from a horror movie being played... (The first had been a movie theater  this one takes place in an apartment building and on TV.) Once the demons are released  madness and mass carnage ensues. That's pretty much it as far as plot development goes. It worked nicely in the first part because of the ghoulish make-up FX  fast pace and unpredictability. The sequel  however  doesn't cut it. The first problem seems to be that there are way too many characters who we don't really care about one way or another. If they were annoying or idiots  then there would at least be some kind of gratification when they are inevitably butchered/demonized/eaten alive...but these people are just kind of there waiting to be slaughtered. Plus  the fact that most of the characters are in different parts of the apartment building (and out of it)  they are constantly cutting back and forth between them  which kept pulling me out of the story. There are some amusing bits  courtesy of the splatter FX and campiness. Such as a constant flow of dripping blood eating through one floor's construction after another as if it were alien acid... The first demon possession of a crabby birthday girl leads to the destruction of her entire party  and a creepy demon child clawing his way into the room of a tenant who is pregnant with child. However  that sequence parlays into a ridiculous-looking rubber demon baby puppet thing that bursts from the chest of the human child that constantly flies across the room at its intended victim. I got a couple of chuckles out of that scene  but I don't think that was Bava's intention. The scene probably would've worked better if they just kept the child demon around to attack the woman  but hey... Other little things like the over-zealous acting of most of the characters and the bad dubbing don't help matters. In summation  I managed to see the unrated version on DVD  and can't imagine having to sit all the way through the previously only available R rated version  because the make-up FX and gore were the only thing I got out of it. Also notable is an early role of producer Argento's future hottie daughter  Asia. In fact  she probably gives the best performance of the whole cast and she's barely on screen. Argento/Bava fan's might want to check it out just to see it  but will probably find themselves looking at their watch  like I did. Gore fans might get a kick out of some of the fx  but will be laughing themselves out of their chairs at the most goofy-looking evil baby puppet since Little Selwyn from Dead/Alive. You could do worse  but it certainly doesn't live up to the original.\n",

      "After Matt Dillon's phenomenal performance in CRASH  most will probably rush to pick up a copy of FACTOTUM to see if Dillon is for real or simply got a lucky rebound from a great script.  Well  Factotum certainly has its moments  but the plainness of ...everything will most likely turn viewers off. However nothing should be taken away from Dillon. His performance is wonderful and full of excellent deadpan humor  proving he's a solid actor with significant chops; it's just a shame about the directing and script.  The story is about Henry Hank Chinaski (Dillon) and his refusal to conform to anything resembling normalcy. He quits or gets fired from jobs in mere minutes  only to find himself back in a dreary pub meeting even drearier women while trying to write a nonconformist novel. We never really know what the novel is about except that it involves everything (cancer  movies  you  me).  Skipping from workplace to workplace and constantly returning to Jan (Lili Taylor  THE HAUNTING)  a loser girlfriend who's just as dispiriting as himself  Hank tries vainly to discover what his life is supposed to hold for him. Whether he ever learns what that is is up for interpretation. Some may say that he never does  while others might argue that his life is simply a path to obscurity.  Regardless  there's not much substance to Factotum even with Matt Dillon's fine performance. The story meanders through Hank's life without much thought given as to where to take the audience. And that's a shame. Dillon's performance would've shone even brighter if given a decent script.\n",

      "The DEA agent's name  Anslinger  is a nice inside joke - this is the name of the former drug czar who almost single-handedly made marijuana illegal.  Despite this bit of book knowledge  the writers go on to have the farmers harvesting and selling fresh undried leaf  rather than cured buds.  Additionally  I always find it amusing that movie makers never seem to be able to find real marijuana plants for filming. You would think there would be a business that would make real looking fake ones for the movie business or maybe they could film a couple of scenes in Amsterdam or Switzerland. I suppose that's asking too much for the budget.  Probably the most interesting thing about the film is the attempt to cover the notion of exactly what is right and what is wrong in society and how the law treads that line and yet tries to do justice in spite of it.  \n",

      "When just days away before the film's premiere  its screenwriter backs out of the project  and demands his name to be removed from the credits  you know that this does not bode well.   The books  on which Wiedzmin is based on  have great potential for a vivacious fantasy film  Geralt de Rivia is a witcher; his sole purpose is to destroy the monsters that plague the world. But not everything monstrous-looking is evil  and not everything fair is good",
      " But all that didn't matter  when a polish film crew  with a low budget  and no  or little appreciation for Sapkowski's work  decided to make a 13-part mini-series out of it. The two-hour film is a by-product of their actions  to maximize the profits.   It's not hard to point out in this case  what makes people label this film as bad. Plot (incoherent  thanks to cramming it with too many stories)  acting (below average  with exception of Zebrowski)  dialogues (bland)  editing (choppy)  special effects (unbearable) and choreography (poor)  add up to the film's overall bad experience. Only the soundtrack  done by Grzegorz Ciechowski  brings out the beauty of the world of Wiedzmin  which was never brought to the screen. Even Poland's grandiose flora and fauna (where part of The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion  the Witch and the Wardrobe was shot)  a crucial element in almost ANY fantasy film  were not used up to their full potential. The more I think about this dead loss  the more I'm running out of words. At least  it's a comfort to know  that Marek Brodzki  the director of Wiedzmin  has directed only one film ever since (in addition  in Germany).   For now  we're left with top-notch fantasy stories and a fantastic computer RPG (released in 2007) referring to the Wiedzmin books. But I'm sure that one day  justice will be done for the Wiedzmin saga  and we'll be treated with an equally good film adaptation soon enough.\n",

This could have been a good movie but the direction was horrible and the plot was about as thin as a sheet of paper. Usually when a movie is this horrendous you can sit back and laugh at it.

      "This slightly ponderous late 50's sci-fi-horror schlock isn't entirely a loser. It's about a manned space rocket that crash lands in a remote area. A bunch of scientists go to investigate and discover that the astronaut is in some kind of coma; he's being kept alive by alien embryos that have been mysteriously implanted in him. Anyway  the title alien monster soon raises it's head causing general havoc  including partial head removal.  The main problem with the film is it's pacing. It takes quite a while for the Blood Beast to appear  and he really only comes into his own in the last 20 minutes or so. He is undoubtedly a completely ridiculous creation but that's really not a problem as he provides a fair amount of comic relief. At the end of the movie where we have the final stand-off and this ludicrous creature starts talking with the voice of the doctor he killed earlier  you will be doing well not to have a giggle. So too in the brilliant x-ray scene where we see the alien embryos floating about in the astronaut's body - it's just too funny for words.  But unfortunately  the fun moments in Night of the Blood Beast come too few and far between. If you're a 50's sci-fi nut though then it's well worth checking this one out.

This  is not one of those films. You know right from the start that bad things are going to happen  and they're mostly stupid things that would never actually happen.

Directed by Fred Olen Ray (about as good an omen as seeing buzzards circle over head in the desert)  this tale of a woman (Thomas) who must protect a high-tech motorcycle from unscrupulous types is about as B movie as it gets (or in Fred Olen's case  B minus).  The cast itself should tell you something. It's not every movie that combines Thomas with actors the calibre of Beswick  Hall  Combs  Donahue  Tamblyn and Landau (!!). If you're lucky  very few movies do. And even though they seem to be having fun  shouldn't some of that fun be passed on to the audience? I vote yes  seems they voted no.

They say you can't judge a book by its cover  but it appears that the same is not true of DVDs: I was in the mood for a REALLY bad horror film last night  and since the cover of Granny featured a shoddily photo-shopped image of the titular killer swinging an axe  terrible typography (they even use the system font Sand  a definite design no-no!)  and credits featuring absolutely no-one I had heard of  I reckoned it would be pretty lousy.

Anyone who actually stays with the film long enough for the killing to begin (and I doubt most sane people would bother) will be treated to several dreadful death scenes featuring amateurish gore  loads of awful acting  and a surprise ending that comes as no surprise (if you've seen April Fool's Day  then you'll guess what the twist is way before it is revealed).  Granny is uninspired  unexciting  and almost unwatchable. Avoid.\n",

      "I wanted to dog this movie  but somehow I can't find it in myself to do that.  Exhibiting a duality of fighting styles  it's Li vs. Li in a somewhat decent battle for supremacy.  This is one of those movies where the story carries the performances. Li's acting is extremely amateurish  hesitant  and stiff for most of this movie...right up to the very end. At first I tricked myself into believing he was just doing that for one of his two characters. You know  to show a difference in personalities. But it appeared to be inexperience or a lack of talent. It did get a bit better  more relaxed  toward the end. But that wasn't enough to save his performance. Jet Li's acting does improve as his career moves forward. I don't hate his acting. I just hated him in this.  I also have to say that the effects were very B class effects. What effects there are.  The story itself had great potential. It was uniquely creative  daring  and fresh. Unfortunately  either the budget was not ample enough to accommodate better lighting  effects  film quality  and some acting lessons  or the director just did not care enough to bother with these little details. He also did not bother with the SCIENCE in the science-fiction. A fact which was a great detractor to this film.  The fight sequences were a bit one sided  as he seemed to give more to one character and little to the other. But all in all the story line made for a very enjoyable attempt.  As enjoyable as this was  I couldn't help but think  all the way through  that this was just one of those movies that you can't help but watch it for what it SHOULD'VE been  rather than what it is.  It rates a 6.0/10 on the B scale.  That's a 4.2/10 (on the A scale) for having a good plot  from...  the Fiend :.\n",

      "Once again Mr. Costner has dragged out a movie for far longer than necessary. Aside from the terrific sea rescue sequences  of which there are very few I just did not care about any of the characters. Most of us have ghosts in the closet  and Costner's character are realized early on  and then forgotten until much later  by which time I did not care. The character we should really care about is a very cocky  overconfident Ashton Kutcher. The problem is he comes off as kid who thinks he's better than anyone else around him and shows no signs of a cluttered closet. His only obstacle appears to be winning over Costner. Finally when we are well past the half way point of this stinker  Costner tells us all about Kutcher's ghosts. We are told why Kutcher is driven to be the best with no prior inkling or foreshadowing. No magic here  it was all I could do to keep from turning it off an hour in.\n",

      "I love musicals  all of them  from joyous Oklahoma  to Poignant Porgy and Bess  to the touching romantic Damn Yankees. And I know most of the songs  sometimes singing them spontaneously  with a crowd or humming them alone.  In a real musical  as differentiated from this vaudeville show  every song is painstakingly crafted to fit the exact moment. It is an expression of sadness  regret  love  joy or exaltation--a natural extension where mere words fail. So  in Guys and Dolls  My Time of Day describes the adventurous life of Sky Masterson as it is about to be compromised by the most unlikely woman. Every song in this brilliant exemplar of the genre sets a mood  or develops a character  creating a phantasmagoria of place  turned absolutely believable by the self disclosing evocations of song.  For this lover of the Broadway Musical  and their adaptations to the screen during the last half of the 20th century  Mama Mia is somewhere between satire and a cruel fun house distortion of the genre. There  the songs of these musicals advanced the often elaborate  often delightful  plot lines. While here  the songs  simply picked up from a collection  only interfered with the shaky premise of the film.  Perhaps most of those viewers who are making this film into a monumental success simply have no exposure to the art form of 20th century Musicals. They have no idea of the magic performed by writer and lyricist that can turn a dance hall floozy into someone whom we know and love  as achieved in Sweet Charity.  Let me offer an apology for the arrogance of this review. Perhaps  another day  another mood  I could have gotten into it  and not have been so critical in this review.  But I can't help but imagining what Richard Roger  Oscar Hammerstein  Cole Porter  Irving Berlin and so many others could have done even with with this silly premise. I think about it  while the memories of seeing this film is fresh  and I can not help but to mourn the great loss.\n",

      "Aimless teens on summer break in a small Ohio town can't find any meaningful ways to fill their time. Some consider driving to Chicago; others are content to drink and bully their peers. In a random act of alcohol-fueled arrogance  the bullies rough up a homeless man and steal a strange book. The handwritten text turns out to contain archaic spells designed to summon demonic forces. A night or two later  one of them reads an incantation and is quickly possessed. He turns into a vicious killer and begins to quietly prey on his former peers.  Demon Summer is an amateur production with a microscopic budget. The production values are low  but the filmmakers were smart enough to not be ambitious. Little in the way of special props or shooting locations were needed. The acting is especially weak and there is virtually nothing original in the screenplay. On the positive side  the special makeup effects are surprisingly good by low budget film standards. Despite this  the gore is minimal. Makeup effects aside  there is little going for this film  even for die-hard gore-hounds. Not recommended.\n",

Watching a full episode convinces me that it really is that bad. I couldn't even tell you what happened but I distinctively remember not laughing. For people who think this is the new All in the Family or Married with Children...have you ever actually WATCHED those shows? They are well written and well acted and most importantly  funny! This show is NOT funny. You might think so if this is the first sitcom you have ever watched. I cannot see who else would. I echo all previous sentiments about Arrested Development  etc...

      "I don't understand how some people can stand playing Half-Life: Counter-Strike when there are so many better first-person shooting games available.  Counter-Strike is a game that doesn't use any imaginative ideas in its weaponry. All the weapons in the game are real-life weapons  but there could have been at least a cheat that allowed players to have access to a supernatural weapon  like the all-powerful BFG in the Quake & Doom games.  Another problem is that the player actually has to reload the weapon manually. This can become extremely annoying  especially while in the middle of a firefight when you are so close to killing the enemy. The reloading delay also gives the feeling that the gun is slow at performing its task.  There are not many choices of characters to choose from. If I remember correctly  there are 4 types of characters each for the Terrorist and Counter-Terrorist forces. This means that many of the characters look the same as each other  which really brings down the game's realism.  The game is pretty sexist when it comes to character selections. In the early version of Counter-Strike  there was a woman available to choose (in the Terrorist force selection) which was good for the female gamers. In the latest versions  however  the female character was deleted and replaced with another male character. I wonder if the women who played the game were disappointed at the newer versions.  Finally  the maps in the game are very small. The biggest map seems to be the desert map  but it has standard detail. In fact  all the maps in the game have standard graphics. In other words  nothing new.  To sum up  I think Half-Life: Counter-Strike is the most un-imaginative first-person shooting game of all time. There are plenty of better & more imaginative shooting games to play  so why waste your time on this boring game? You're better off playing the Unreal Tournament  Quake  and Doom games. Avoid this over-rated & over-hyped game.  I give the game a 1/10.\n",

      "What an uninteresting hodge-podge. It could have been something more but no imagination seems to have gone into the script or the direction. A man is framed for murder by his wife and her lover. The conspirators do a pretty thorough job of making him look guilty. But the man (Richard Thomas)  whose psychiatric records reveal him as stable and unimaginative  manages to escape from jail  beat it to the conspirator's beach house  and secretly record a conversation between them in which they reveal their guilt. Then he accidentally drops the tape recorder with all the evidence on it into the sea water but manages to retrieve it. He shows a heck of a lot of creativity and improvisational skill for an unimaginative guy  if you ask me.  The tape is now damaged goods but it's enough to break down the wife's lover and he sobs out his confession. Bad people are punished. Good people are saved.  The location shooting is impressive. The beach house is nothing more than a wooden exterior thrown up on the grounds of Fort Fisher Battlefield on the Cape Fear peninsula. The house was torn down immediately after the production wrapped.  It's a pretty place. Unfortunately it's a little hard to see because someone seems to have shot every scene through a pair of pantyhose stretched over the camera lens. It's all very fuzzy. And for all the natural splendor of the location the viewer never gets a real sense of place  of what the sand feels like  of the texture of the gray bark on the stunted evergreens.  The acting is okay but the performers have nothing much to work with. The best performance  as is often the case  is given by Dick Olsen as a sleazy but not unsympathetic defense lawyer. Virginia Madsen radiates infidelity with every beat of her eyelashes. Ted McGinley is within his range as an immoral weakling.  The musical score neatly blends the ominous with the mysterious and is effective. If you want to hear the original  from which this was ripped off  rent Hitchcock's Vertigo and listen to Bernard Hermann's suspenseful theme.  I can't think of any particular reason to catch this one except utter boredom.\n",

      "Well  first of all  excuse me for the lame pun in the title. I was browsing for movies to rent the other day and saw this. I heard something about this so I picked it up and looked on the back and there was a short little review blurb on it from John Fallon AKA Arrow in the Head! At that moment I thought Well if he likes it then I gotta like it! So I rented it and just finally got around to watching it last night (college keeps me so busy). Oh and I might wanna add that I read a little of Arrow's review and it turns out that out of 4 stars he gave it 1 and a half. So my expectations from this movie went from very high to iffy. Well after watching this  I once again agree with Arrow (and turns out that quote from the review was the only positive thing he said about that!) Wow  did this film stink or what? Where do I begin with why it did so? Well  the film was so dull in my opinion. Not even the cool gore bits excited me and when a decapitation doesn't excite you in a movie  that's bad! The characters I hated a lot and from the beginning I could tell who would die and who wouldn't. Actually the film proved me wrong at some points  but the worst thing is that one particular character I wanted to die didn't! What the heck? And the chemistry between the main girl and the guy she met? Didn't feel it. He obviously was just there to be eye candy and give her a love interest  otherwise I thought he was a waste! And as a horror fan I should know that doing the dumb horror movie sometimes gotta happen or else there wouldn't be much of a movie  but the ones in here ticked me off! Hello? Why are you making out in the room of the killer nun when you should be on the lookout from her? And it was done by the supposedly smarter characters no less. The twist....ah  it would have been alright  if it hadn't been done a billion times and I didn't have to sit through this wast of film to reach that point!

      "There is something about Doug McLure's appearance in a movie that is a warranty of wretchedness. His DG initials are like a special cinema-certification  that comes somewhere before 'U'.   Cushing  on the other hand  seemed to suffer from both a dilatory agent and poor judgement of his own. He did excellent work in the Hammer movies as Dr Van Helsing. I'v seen him do a very passable Sherlock Holmes in 'Hound Of The Baskervilles'. And his magnum opus was probably Grand Moff Tarkin in the first 'Star Wars'. The only man but the emperor who could tell Darth Vadar to 'stop bickering' and get away with it. But - crikey! - he's done some turkeys. There was that lamentable 'Daleks' movie for one. And here's another.  There's a machine that's been hijacked from Tracy Island. It's a cylinder with a screw at the front and traction devices at the sides. I'm surprised Jerry Anderson didn't sue for plagiarism. Maybe he was bought-off. Yet if the movie is any guide  they can't have paid him much.  It's 1976 and we're still playing about in latex romper-suits.   That's about it really. Some movies have an entertainment value in the 'so bad it's good' category. This one doesn't even manage that.

      "Ruggero Deodato is often credited for inventing the cannibal subgenre with JUNGLE HOLOCAUST in 1975. But director Umberto Lenzi  usually acknowledged as a Deodato rip-off  directed THE MAN FROM DEEP RIVER 3 years earlier in 1972. Is it a worthy start for the genre? Well....not really.....  A photographer accidentally kills a man in self-defense and while retreating into the jungles of an Asian country  is captured by a native tribe who hold him captive  force him into slave labor  and eventually accept him when he marries the chief's daughter. Throughout the whole film  I never felt this was a horror film. It was more reminiscent of a drama  like A MAN CALLED HORSE  which I liked better. Ivan Rassimov is pretty good as the photographer  but it is Me Me Lai as the chief's daughter who is memorable and great. I have always been a Me Me Lai fan ever since her breathtaking performance in JUNGLE HOLOCAUST and she is never given credit for her acting chops because she hardly speaks in her films. She is still very talented and charming. Lots of real animal mutilation is the one thing about DEEP RIVER that could make it a horror film  but even that doesn't execute well.  THE MAN FROM DEEP RIVER is good to see for those who want to see what started the cannibal subgenre  but as an entry in the genre  is easily eclipsed by Deodato's entries and even Lenzi's own later entries. Recommended only for completists and Me Me Lai fans.\n",

Heavyweights Jason Statham and Welsey Snipes serve as bookends to Phillippe  but when they're not on the screen Phillippe flounders; his shallow acting style has nothing to bounce off of.  The script is a typical late 20th century potboiler good cop/bad cop with a ridiculously predictable plot and dialogue lifted out of 1970s TV cop shows  such as The Streets of San Francisco. Snipes reprises his role as the eternal black-hat villain  playing a slightly less crazed madman than his Demolition Man role. However  there wasn't much for Snipes and Statham to chew on. Statham's character announces he'd given up nicotine and caffeine - something this movie badly needed injections of.

And she certainly do not look like the female warrior who could easily kick some veteran warrior kings butt  but she does. And whats with the feminist attitude  it's plain hypocrisy.

      "This belabored and sloppy spy melodrama featuring two buffoonish (one idealistic  one drug addled) California kids dealing secrets to the KGB never seems to get enough steam up to sustain any tension and suspense before it dies a very slow death over two hours later. John Schlesinger's finished product gives the impression that he was asleep in his director's chair most of the time as the film lags and the actors sleep walk  save for the highly annoying over the top performance of Sean Penn.   Childhood altar boys and friends Chris (Tim Hutton) and Daulton (Penn) devise a plan to sell secrets to the KGB when Chris lands a job that allows him access to top secret government materials. Disillusioned by what he sees as US meddling in foreign affairs the idealistic Chris and the drug hungry Daulton make contact with the Russians and begin to funnel them classified materials. When Chris decides he wants out things begin to unravel at a lackadaisical pace.   The eighties were not kind to distinguished director John Schlesinger. In the 60s and 70s he had a series of critically acclaimed films in both England and America but then came Honky Tonk Freeway in 1981 and it marked the beginning of the end. The Falcon and the Snowman more or less put a lid on it. Lacking the suspense of Marathon Man and the quality performances (Hoffman Voight  Christie  Jackson  Finch  Olivier) he had coaxed from leads in the past Falcon goes in circles most of the way.   Sean Penn chews scenery from start to finish in such an obnoxious fashion you find yourself encouraging his torturers to do more to him. Tim Hutton is governed by his limited acting chops and most of his scenes show a need for more rehearsal time. Lori Singer as Hutton's girlfriend plays it mute most of the way with Schlesinger content to film her vapid expressions. When she does emote you understand why. Only David Suchet as the KGB handler with a piercing eyed introspective presence and restraint acquits himself well.\n",

Tommy Lee Jones  a normally fine actor  just doesn't capture Burke's Dave Robicheaux. As Robicheaux's main nemesis  John Goodman does a sloppy job as the heavy. The guy who plays Robicheaux's actor-buddy doesn't look like a former A lister leading man. The rest of the movie is mainly cast with no-name locals who just don't do justice to a big-time novel.  The movie and Jones' performance is way too hurried for one thing. Robicheaux in Burke's series of novels  gives one the feeling that he fits well into his environment most of the time  being laid back and slow-moving. This is just like the deep south and southern Louisiana. Then at times Robicheaux is nearly manic in his exertions. Jones just moves at a fast pace through the whole movie. He doesn't vary. Ned Beatty is wasted. Mary Steenburgen is out of place. About the only good thing about this is the setting. On the whole the movie gives one the impression of a TV movie.\n",

Shirley MacLaine directed and stars as the child's grandmother  and it is always fascinating to see long-time actors getting their chance at directing a film  the material that they're drawn to and the actors they choose to work with. Here  the only person well-cast in Bruno is MacLaine. The child actors seem to have been picked for their twinkle and cuteness  and squishy-hearted MacLaine holds their close-ups for excruciatingly long periods; nothing about these cherubs seems natural  not the lines that fall without consciousness out of their mouths or the interaction they have with adults or even each other. As the boy's disgruntled father  poor Gary Sinise hovers around the edges  in mock shame  always with a pained look on his face. Towards the end of the film  MacLaine turns the whole thing into a passel of hugging scenes  and even concludes with the kid hugging the Pope in Rome! Another ungodly treatise from a talented actress-turned-director who  much like Sally Field and her film Beautiful  cannot seem to stop winking at and nudging the audience. Shirley uses ethnicity for shtick  and childhood innocence as a punchline.

      "The key scene in Rodrigo Garcia's Nine Lives comes when Sissy Spacek  hidden away in a hotel room where she is carrying on an affair with Aiden Quinn  find a nature documentary on television  at which point Quinn notes the contrivance of such things--disparate footage is edited into one scene  predators and preys are thrown together in order to capture the moment--all to force connections where none actually exist. Characters in the nine shorts that make up this film occasionally spill over into each others stories  but none of them ever seem to really connect. A woman preparing for a violent confrontation with her abusive father is later seen working in a hospital room where another woman is preparing for a mastectomy. A man who runs into an old girlfriend in a supermarket and sees how his life should have been later hosts  with his current wife  a dinner party for an unhappy couple. Garcia arranges some of his characters in front of each other  but none of the subsequent stories ever really build on what came before.  Garcia's first film  the wonderful  overlooked Things You Can Tell Just By Looking At Her  also had a short-story structure and overlapping characters  but there were fewer of them and they had a lot more room to breathe and grow. The gimmicky premise of Nine Lives  that each of its nine stories is told in a single  unbroken take in real time  never allows the film to build up any real dramatic tension or momentum. It's also a fairly visually ugly movie. Interior shots are often murky and hard to watch  while other scenes--particularly one where a girl walks back and forth between rooms to talk to her uncommunicative parents--are rendered annoying by the camera-work. Given that this is Garcia's third film and that he has a respectable history of directing for television  the direction in this film is rather surprisingly amateurish. Like fellow filmmaker-child-of-a-great-writer Rebecca Miller  Garcia (son of Gabriel Garcia Marquez) is focused on the writing and character aspects of his films often to the detriment of the film-making ones.  Individual scenes are touching and even affecting. I did like Jason Issacs kissing Robin Wright Penn's pregnant belly. And Joe Mantegna whispering lovingly to his wife as she slips into pre-surgery sedation. And Sissy Spacek stealing a few happy moments away from her life with Aiden Quinn before brought back to it with a phone call from her daughter. But the film (unlike Things You Can Tell Just By Looking At Her) feels more like an exercise than actual drama. We are just watching people act.\n",

      "This film is terrible. Not only is the story unbelievable  the situations the characters put themselves in are so silly  to the point where it isn't shocking. I find it sad that Daisy Eagan  star of Broadway's The Secret Garden  decided that this would be a career step. The idea is interesting  two young girls coming of age very quickly. But the sex isn't even arousing. The film is silly  the story is silly  the performances are silly  and the whole concept while interesting falls flat. I'm sure all 14 year old girls make out with guys after they've had their first period and tried to flush their panties down the toilet. Better Luck next time guys. My Scale * T-Scale *\n",

      "Being a huge Laura Gemser fan  I picked this up at a rental outlet just to see another Emanuelle film. Boy  did I make a mistake!  EMANUELLE IN EGYPT has nothing to do with Emanuelle. Laura Gemser is in it along with her husband Gabriele Tinti  but that is the only connection to Emanuelle. Here  Laura plays Laura (original  huh?) a beautiful supermodel who goes to visit her wealthy friend Pia (Annie Belle) in Egypt. In tow are her a**hole photographer Carlo (a haggard-looking Gabriele Tinti) and some blonde woman who is never named. Also living in Pia's mansion is Horatio (the sexy but dumb Al Cliver)  a mystique who speaks nothing but nonsense. Arriving for the weekend are Pia's two daughters  one a short-haired lesbian and the other a brunette. Lots of sex is implied  but hardly shown. One good-looking actor plays Ali  the Egyptian servant  who gets lucky with three of the women in the mansion. Laura has sex with the lesbian  the lesbian has sex with Horatio  Pia and the blonde have sex with Horatio at an Egyptian orgy  Laura drinks goats' blood and is possessed during an Egyptian ceremony  Carlo rapes Laura. It all happens with so little flair that EMANUELLE IN EGYPT is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Far from erotic  even the actors themselves look bored during their sex scenes.  Considering there were two famous couples in this film (Laura and Gabriele & Al and Annie)  the number of available sex scenes are uncountable. Instead  a film that offers a top-notch Eurocult cast and never delivers the goods will piss every viewer off  except the hardcore Laura Gemser completist. Otherwise  steer clear of EMANUELLE IN EGYPT!\n",

      "... Said the continuity announcer as TACTICAL ASSAULT was about to be broadcast . After seeing the first two minutes I started thinking Rutger might want to get a new agent . After seeing the next ten minutes I started thinking Rutger might want to retire thereby saving a potential audience from any more of his performances   Yup this is a truly terrible movie . I wasn't expecting much and why should I if the name Rutget Hauer appeared in the credits   but within seconds of the opening title credits that featured NATO warplanes with USSR markings bombing Bosnia I realised I was going to be force fed inedible turkey three months after Christmas .  The attention to detail is non existent . NATO planes carry USSR markings then were told Hauer's character spent six years in an Iraqi prison which would make the setting 1997 . What NATO were bombing the Serbs in 1997 ! I guess the producers didn't think the audience would have noticed this ridiculous inaccuracy but I know I did . The producers also probably hoped the audience wouldn't notice the lack of continuity such as dogfights with Iraqi jets that suddenly turned from Migs to F-4 Phantoms then back again but I did . Even stranger characters would take off in F-16s then when they arrive back at base there jet has changed into a Soviet built Mig   Oh and if you're expecting a dumb action movie you're only half right because it's dumb but most of the plot centres around a BASIC INSTINCT revenge plot . I'll give the producers some credit ( Maybe credit is too strong a word ) because after seeing plots featuring nannies from hell   policemen from hell   flat mates from hell we now have a fighter pilot from hell which means every single occupation of the 20th century has featured in a from hell type plot with perhaps TATICAL ASSUALT being the worst movie of the lot\n",

      "YOU BELONG TO ME (1941) is a example of the 'ScrewBall Comedy' which started in the mid 1930s and ended postwar (WWII). Some of these films maintained their status. Others have earned undeserved praise when originally were critical and box office flops. Like BRINGING UP BABY (1938) or MR. & MRS. SMITH (1941). Then there is this one which value just keeps sinking.  Why can be rooted in the screenplay/story. It strains credibility from the get go  betraying a superior cast. BARBARA STANWYCK is married to millionaire HENRY FONDA who is insanely jealous. He would be content to sit back with his million$ and love her  she wishes to maintain her profession as a Doctor. She wants him to become in what her eyes is a useful member of society. This conflict is supposed to amuse us. It cannot be salvaged by either the principals or the supporting cast.  The faults in this scenario can clearly be laid at the feet of DALTON TRUMBO. HENRY FONDAs' character is written in such broad strokes that any viewer has a instant dislike for him. BARBARA STANWYCK just has nothing to do but react to each idiotic situation of jealousy. TRUMBO must have been spending to much time outside the studio being a useful idiot then being on the job. COLUMBIA obviously did not get their moneys worth from him  maybe ROBERT RISKIN should taken over.\n",

      "Is the Cannes controversy-meter remarkably esoteric  or is that we Americans are so callous and cynical that we never bother to read between the lines anymore? Be that as it may  with plenty of careful analyzing  Falscher Bekenner at no point seems to live up to the hyped controversy it supposedly brought to Cannes in 2005  a puzzlingly drab and aimless movie that rather lives up to it's glum American re-title (Low Profile).  Building on familiar themes of Bourgeoise angst and subsequent sexual liberation (kind of)  admittedly it's a film not without it's surface-level interests. It starts out with a grabber  as a haunting shot of a desolate off-the-highway road focuses in on a teenage drifter  who ultimately walks by a totaled car  where supposedly a brutal hit-and-run has left the driver dead in a gory mess. Stunned  he does nothing but pick up a scrap of the remaining engine.  Just out of school  the drifter turns out to be Armin Steebe  a product of the German suburbs with minimal ambition. Persisentily pressured by his caring but somewhat nagging parents to find a good job  he endures interview after interview with every haughty interviewer along with it  every one with the same fruitless outcome. Getting mighty sick of it  his aforementioned highway encounter soon provokes his first act of rebellion: claiming responsibility for the crime which he did not commit.  Pretending to fill out more applications and going to more and more bizarre job interviews by sunrise  he partakes in roadside sexual fantasies and petty vandalism way after sundown. As the days get shorter and the nights get much hotter  as he goes on living in his suburban neighborhood as if he's doing nothing out of the ordinary.  If you seem confused about what exactly is going on  don't worry about being the only one: this is about as far and coherent as the story gets. The plot seems simple enough  and perhaps due to it's seemingly direct purposes that's why Falscher Bekenner becomes pointlessly convoluted  becoming enamored with endless false conclusions  dreamlike situations and graphic sex scenes to try and enlighten a story lacking clear logic to an already vague argument (supposedly the soul-numbing effects of the modern suburban wasteland  or something about youth's fascination with crime. Hey  it could even be a coming-out movie.) at hand. It spends a lot of time creating numerous symbols  both tangible and surrealistically allegorical  but they don't seem to be really symbolizing anything of interest.   The most fatal flaw  however  is how the filmmakers paint all it's characters in a rough shade of vanilla. There's hardly any distinguishable traits to help understand their purpose  and how the secondary characters (especially the confused relationship between Armin and his rather normal- perhaps too normal- family) catalyze the already under-developed lead character's plight never comes into focus. How are we supposed to identify with this young almost-adult's rebellion  with little sense of the world he's living in or the prominent figures around him that help comprise it?   Many people drop in and out of the movie (including Armin's sort-of girlfriend Katja  and a strange  affluent visitor who for some reason finds pleasure in watching the protagonist eat brownies) and seem to exist for no reason whatsoever. They ultimately just seem like prolonged padding to an already thin story with pointless subplots that continue to prove the movie is drawing a total blank about where to go next.  And even a movie that supposedly toys with reality (especially with Armin's nightly exploits)  it ends with a literal  almost moralizing head-scratcher that seems to halt questions to a story that does little but put it's viewer in a state of pointlessly exhausted perplexion.  Without any color  it's impossible to shade anything vital in.\n",

The bulk if not all the movie is the Howell character wondering through the devastation  meeting one person  they join him and he looses them for one reason or the other. There's not more then two people on camera at any given moment though most of the movie. It's like if they filmed three at once it would put the movie over budget or something.

      "The original Psycho (1960) is widely considered as Alfred Hitchcock's best work and certainly  in my opinion  is one of the best movies of all time. The decision to film a shot by shot remake is therefore  a little puzzling.  The cast in the original was flawless  so the cast of this remake had a lot to live up to. Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates was not a good choice for the lead. He is too much of a pretty boy hunk and is not very convincing as Bates. I can imagine actors such as Mark Wahlberg or John Turturro doing a much better job in the role. Anne Heche as Marion Crane does a creditable job  but one keeps mentally comparing her to Janet Leigh. Julianne Moore is a much better actress than she shows here and Viggio Mortenson merely walks through his role. The best of this new cast is William H. Macy as the private detective.  Although director Gus Van Sant does an acceptable job  he can't build the suspense the way Hitchcock did. And why did he change the scene in the basement of the house? In the original  the atmosphere is dark and damp and closed in  whereas in this version  it takes place in a brightly lit laboratory like setting. And I think the black & white photography of the original has a definite advantage over the color version.  Maybe another flaw could be the fact that most moviegoers have seen the original and know what is going to happen and when.  All I can say is if it ain't broke  don't fix it.  \n",

      "First of all  just let me say this... Ghost Story....hello!?!  If any of the other people who trashed this movie from beginning to end realized this fact  their reviews would have been very different. The fact that characters kept disappearing whenever the protagonist turned back to look  should have been a dead giveaway. This movie was not billed as a ghost story when you went to rent it in the video store  not even a hint  and that is the BIGGEST mistake that was made by the studio who marketed it. It was deliberate on their part not to market it as a ghost story in order to confuse you like the main character is confused as you try to make sense of it. The problem in this is that they lost too many viewers; the ghosts appeared too human and real without any of the usual telltale signs  imagery or special effects that Hollywood usually uses to let you know you are now seeing a ghost...and that  is what they were trying to do. The main character does not know she is seeing ghosts and neither does the viewer. Now do you get it? As long as you understand that the main character is seeing ghosts  then you'll understand the movie and not be so irritated by what is perceived as major oversights in continuity or plot flaws.  I admit  this being said  it still was not a good movie  just not as bad a just about everyone else made it out to be. Just understand  if you plan on watching this movie  everything you see  ain't always what what you think it is. 4 out of 10 for acting  3 for originality  5 for plot and 5 for scare factor  though there was some gore and spooky moments.

      "Calling this film a decent or enjoyable horror tribute is far too optimistic. Heck  you can't even refer to it as a nice spoof of the genre because it's way below average ( it's funny  but not haha-funny  you know). But still I'd say to give it a look. If only for the huge amount of trivia elements in it. By the way  all those people who're complaining about this movie here in their comments have only themselves to blame. When you see the DVD-cover of this film  you should already know that it's not going to be on the same level as The Piano for example  so don't come complaining afterwards...  Evil Ed could've been something but the totally screwed it up. I suppose the main idea behind this film is criticism towards the growing 'cutting-committee' in horror nowadays. It shows an editor named Edward who's slowly (well not too slowly) going nuts by seeing all the violence and gore in the movies produced by his company produced. The big boss is named Sam Campbell...Funny  isn't it ? Personally I also expected a character named Bruce Raimi  but to my surprise there wasn't. Anyway  this guy became rich by making movies called Loose Limbs. They feature ( and I'm not kidding you! ) scenes in which a girl is getting raped by a BEAVER (?) and then gets shot in the head by a bazooka !!! Now  who says horror isn't original anymore ?  With all the gore and the 'loose limbs'  it's hard to believe it but it really gets boring very quick. After a decent first 25 minutes  Evil Ed turns into complete boredom and never recovers from that. The only think left to do then ( besides pushing the eject-button  of course ) is look for the obvious amount of references to other  much better horror films. I saw scenes obviously stolen from The Evil Dead  Silence of the Lambs  Braindead and several others.And there's a huge amount of classic horror posters on the walls to admire as well.  Evil Ed finds it origin in Sweden. I'm convinced there's a lot up talent there  far North ( take the Danish Nattevagten as an example )...but none of them talents joined the cast or crew of Evil Ed. Only to see if you're in a dumb mood and you don't want to use your brain at all.\n",

      "If you are like me and observed the original Benji phenomenon from afar  finally seeing the movie for the first time 30+ years later  you may be shocked to discover how truly awful it is  and more mystified than ever about its popularity back in 1974.  My judgment is not entirely objective as I tend to have a favorable bias toward children's films and for that reason cut them considerable slack. On the other hand I have always hated this particular dog  a feature on the last couple seasons of Petticoat Junction. Never a great show  the dog-less early episodes were at least a nice showcase of beautiful actresses and the introduction of the dog cut into their screen time.  Benji is an 86-minute mega-dose of the dog  following him on several daily circuits through the town of McKinney  Texas. If this sounds boring you would be advised to give Benji a wide birth and to never let your remote control fall into the hands of a Benji fan (if there are still any out there).   Unlike My Dog Skip  Monkey Business or Because of Winn-Dixie the human actors in the cast are extremely weak. Big Valley's Peter Breck plays the standard stern father and just seems to embarrassed at the idea of appearing in something this lame.

      "I don't normally write reviews  in fact  I never write reviews. This film was so atrocious it actually inspired me to start. Virtual Sexuality attempts to be a light hearted and cheeky teenage comedy regarding the usual trappings; virginity  boys etc. except the main character apparently turns into her perfect boy that she has created using the help of a machine at a technology fair.   Sound interesting? Well  it isn't. The acting is the most half-hearted and appalling I have ever seen. The unfortunate thing is they appear to be genuinely supportive of script and movie  which probably explains why I have never seen them in any memorable production since. I have not bothered to learn the actors names  nor their characters. The lading lady does not enrapture or charm you and  thus  you do not care for her whatsoever. The leading lady's male friend raises no sympathy even when the script is vociferously screaming for you to pity him. The only rise he will get out of you is one of extreme anger and sudden violence. The only half decent actor was the blonde leading man  who  despite his miserably weak role  really gave it all he could  which wasn't much in the light of such a horrendous piece of work. I will not even talk about the acting abomination that are the 'bad guys' of the plot. But then again  what plot?  I watched this film unfold incredulously  as I had absolutely no idea how anyone would have the foolish audacity to write such a script  nevermind produce  act in  and direct it. I can only wonder. The only reason my companion and I continued to watch such a mangled example of film was the disbelieving laughter it managed to arise out of us as cohesion  logic  class and even impotent storyline were disregarded within half an hour into the film. I have completely no idea why anyone wanted to violate the movie industry by releasing this to the public. This is a joke of a film and is best left to gather dust in warehouses for the rest of eternity. 1/2 out of 10. If that.\n",

      "POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILER  It's not a terribly objective review but I just found this movie horribly depressing. Like a lot of Russell T. Davies'  work  it asks more questions than it can answer. His best work (Bob & Rose  Doctor Who) revels in hope against the odds and perseverance even after apparent defeat. These uplifting themes seemed strangely absent here. I suppose the fact that I'm still thinking about it days after viewing is a testament to the quality of the program but the resolution was just too bleak for my tastes.   I would  however  disagree with the reviews I've read complaining that the end feels tacked on. I think each conclusion follows logically from its premise and the ending represented a sound personal belief that neatly resolved the primary theme of the show. While I never really questioned the progression of events  I felt like there was much that could have been expanded upon. I've also read that it was originally conceived as a four part series instead of two  and it's possible that the truncation has done some harm to the completed piece. However  these flaws appear throughout  in sequences and themes that sometimes feel rough or sketched in.  To his credit Davies is totally unafraid to write big  and you have to admire the sheer audacity and scope of this project. The premise he tackles here is the stuff of movies or novels  it is a brave and ambitious thing to tackle it in the medium of television. Strong points include Christopher Eccleston  who is positively mesmeric in the lead. For me  he was and remains the best reason to watch. The depiction of the Messiah's humanity was brilliant  thought provoking and engaging and a real credit to both Davies' writing and Eccleston's acting. I also thought the depiction of the modern world's reaction to the second coming rang true.   So  two stars simply because I personally want my entertainment to be entertaining. I would rather be uplifted or  at least  distracted by my fiction. I have a whole big real world around me  as filtered through CNN or the newspapers -- if I choose to be horribly depressed. There are definitely less subjective reasons by which to judge this piece but I'm afraid my judgment in this matter is clouded by my emotional response.\n",

OK so that's clear  but this is one of those films that was quite obviously trying to be something better  but didn't make it. Why not? Well it would be easy to blame the plot  but heh we've seen worse  there weren't too many holes and heh I know there's not a lot of originality in it but then that needn't kill a film. The effects aren't bad (if you completely ignore the last scene)  the monster is OK  the truck quite menacing so where did it go wrong? Well I'd love to blame it on the 'Chris Moyles' look-a-like Harley... so I will! Comedy and horror are difficult to mix well  bad comedy and horror even worse and there's the problem. I loathed this guy from the moment he stuck his head up (literally)  the continual bating of the overly meek Adam becomes annoying  so annoying that you lose belief that the mildest of people wouldn't react by pushing him out of the moving car door... and I thought it was the monster bits that the director was meant to have trouble convincing us of. Why are bad movies fun? Well you have great fun poking holes in them  laughing at the script  all the howlers etc. This film doesn't make the coveted category of 'Worst Movies' because its just bad due to being annoying nuff said.

      "The word honor should be erased from the vocabularies of all nations. It aggravates male dumbness and is responsible for the death of millions of innocent people. Anybody who does not agree should not care to continue reading this comment.  As can be expected with these screenwriters  Yakuza is an engaging crime thriller with quite a lot of respect for the ethnical background against which it is acted out. Friends of gore and violence will not be disappointed either  but especially towards the end violence becomes somewhat pointless  redundant and downright silly. Contrary to other reviewers I found Robert Mitchum's performance not very good. This is an actor who definitely did not improve with age. He looks like a tired janitor (it does not go too well with the part)  and his air of detachment which made him such an impressive screen presence in earlier years comes through as either confusion or lack of interest. Ken Takakura and Richard Jordan are very good as man of honor and young  intelligent  feeling thug respectively.  The best way to stand this movie is seeing it as a tragic comedy. Things are set in motion by the Mitchum character's asking the Takakura character a favor based on wrong assumptions. The error quickly becomes evident  but the sense of honor demands they must not back off. So they start sneaking around  shooting in all directions  wielding swords and wrecking their friend's arty apartment (although the guy pleads with them stop it  please all through the corresponding fight). Bodies start piling up and the story ends with Mitchum's character making his point: If YOU give HIM YOUR little finger  I will give YOU MINE. Well  it's the least he can do  can't he? So he pulls out a knife  takes a resigned breath and starts sawing off said extremity (outside the frame  luckily). It was a moment which probably should have been solemn. It just made me laugh.  The use of locations is very good in this movie. I particularly liked the scenes filmed in and around the International Conference Hall on Lake Takaragaike  an interesting futuristic building by architect Sachio Otani (the Kyoto protocol was signed there). To me the presentation of architecture seems better here than in Sydney Pollack's more recent documentary Sketches of Frank O. Gehry which is about architecture and nothing else.\n",

      "If you read the plot summary for Mad Max  you've just ruined the first 1 hour and 10 minutes of the film. You've also found out that Mad Max takes place in post-apocalyptic Australia  which will be helpful because otherwise you won't have any idea what's going on. The film  made in 1979  tries really hard to be Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange (1971) only that film  in all its strangeness  actually makes sense and leaves an impact. This film does neither and ends up being a car/bike stunt-filled romp that crashes like every vehicle in the film does.  The first thing wrong with Mad Max is that it tries to sell itself as a revenge tale when no vigilante appears to take revenge until the final 20 minutes. If the first hour were condensed to 20-30 minutes and then the final 20 added on and then another hour added after that  Mad Max would be a cool action film with a great vigilante protagonist. Instead  Mel Gibson has to wait around and act like a sissy for 2/3 of the film and then have a sudden epiphany to seek revenge. I've yet to watch the sequel Road Warrior and I have to admit I'm excited for it only because I want to know what he does next. This first film was mostly a waste of time.  George Miller does some great action stuff here  but his over-the-top symbolism is absurd and the unbearable cheesy reaction sequences every time a character discovers something horrifying like a burnt hand or what have you completely ruins those moments. Its a terribly cliché B-movie technique.  There is absolutely no thematic value or subtle critique of society in this film no matter what you might think. A great action sci-fi movie at least makes a point  but the gratuitous violence done by random  weird bikers doesn't say anything of value. Even the villain Toecutter feels modeled off Alex of Clockwork only uglier and completely unimposing. The PG violence just does not allow the violence of this gang to settle in and get a reaction from the viewer  it just cheeses it up if anything.  I'll give credit for the amount of stuff the film crew blew up and crashed into things and Miller does a great job making you feel the intensity of the collisions. Everything else is mediocre at best and then after an hour of mediocrity  you get something good and the film ends 20 minutes later. I'm just crossing my fingers Road Warrior will fulfill the expectations of where this film ends  otherwise that's more time wasted. ~Steven C  Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com\n",

Brightly-painted comedy-of-ills is as out of touch with reality as Ameche's doddering old coot. Perhaps a serious first draft (with scenes such as Ameche walking out into traffic with two toddlers) was incorporated into a sillier second or third version (with Selleck getting poked  bumped  prodded  and eventually losing a toe and a testicle!).

The cliffhanger scene at the end had me laughing until my insides hurt. The script was dreadful enough  but coupled with Sean Young's terrible acting -- especially while she explains the entire plot in great detail (complete with flashbacks) while dangling off a cliff -- makes it a truly classically bad movie worth watching! In fact the fakey shots in this scene reminded me of an Ed Wood movie. I still can't believe how this thing got made. First of all  how did such a bad script get the green light?

      "Yes  the votes are in. This film may very well be the Plan 9 From Outer Space for our generation. But whereas Ed Wood's film  for all its flaws  retains a certain charm despite it all  this film defines the word charmless to the nth degree. In fact  I'd suggest to the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary to cite this movie as a key example defining the that word in the next update to the dictionary.  Carrot Top is a performer of such abysmal ability that normally rational people that I know once they hear his name become homicidal maniacs dedicated to wanting to kill Mr. Top as soon as possible. Indeed  if one goes to Amazon.com and look at customer reviews for Carrot Top's movie and other performance DVD  one will find several that could be construed as death threats to Mr. Top.  One other curious fact about this film  I recall that Mike Nelson  the head writer for MST 3000  in his book Mike's Mega Cheese about movies  good and bad  said he saw this film and shortly afterwords couldn't recall a thing about it  including the title. Obviously Mike was suffering a classic reaction to trauma. Viewing this atrocity was so soul numbing  Mike Nelson had to block it from his mind. (Evidently  in a later chapter in his book  Mike Nelson had recovered his memeory of this film. From the review he offers  Mike Nelson was definitely not grateful for the recovered memory.)  The only comment I offer about the film  and it is not a spoiler  it's simply God's honest truth  it's not funny. None of it is  not even a nanosecond of it is funny.\n",

      "Ugh. Pretty awful.  Linnea Quigley gets top billing  but her character doesn't have a big part. Who is her character supposed to be anyway  the little boy's aunt? Another user commented on her getting nude in a shower scene. While there was a shower scene in the movie  it was a head and shoulders shot. Perhaps there are some alternate versions of this movie.  Quigley does have a bigger part than John Carradine  Cameron Mitchell  and Brinke Stevens  though. Carradine shows up briefly in a monkish robe reciting vague dialog. No other characters are in the scene with him  though he's sort of composited in  or else there are over-the-shoulder shots unquestionably belonging to someone else. There's also a really bad photo of him in a cameo locket (it looks like a bad photocopy)  and a decent picture of him in a family bible. He conjured up Jack-O originally  or something like that.  Cameron Mitchell briefly shows up on a TV as a TV horror host. Brinke Stevens is in the movie he's showing The Coven  in which she runs around a cemetery in a robe. Evidently there's more of the Brinke footage as a bonus feature on the Retromedia DVD double feature Mark of the Witch/The Brides Wore Blood.  Jack-O: what's it about? Darn if I know. A little boy is told a story about a pumpkin-headed demon killer  and he and some other kids are scared by a woman they think is a witch for some reason. She follows him home and offers to help his family with their haunted garage for Halloween (put your hand through a hole and feel eyeballs that are actually grapes  etc.). The pumpkin-headed killer shows up several times to hold onto branches while he watches people  or hold his scythe in front of the camera and pose with it for a while. Sometimes he manages to do more than just stand around holding things  and actually kills people.  There are also some flashbacks to a western or prairie family  with the little boy playing the little boy in that family too: ancestors of his  I think. I think they figure into Jack-O's backstory  but I'm not sure how.  The little boy is ostensibly the main character  but we don't really learn anything about him except that he wears glasses  has nightmares  and will fight bullies even if he'll get beat up in the process. More time should have been spent establishing his character. I couldn't have cared less if he died.  Not recommended  not even for Halloween.\n",

I don't know; maybe I didn't like this movie because of the fact that I rented it along with Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and Phone Booth  both of which are excellent films  or maybe it's because I'm used to so much better from Martin  or maybe it's just because I'm in a frickin' bad mood today...Regardless  this film just wasn't very funny or entertaining  and I never managed more than a smile or a weak chuckle at the film's gags  which is really a shame  since the previews of this comedy were SO promising!

      "(This is a review of the later English release by Disney  featuring Alison Lohman  Patrick Stewart  and co.)   I really wanted this film to be good. Really  really. I'm a huge fan of Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away  and after seeing all the glowing reviews on this earlier Miyazaki film  I was eager to see it. But I was shocked  shocked I say  at the quality of this film. Those later films boast well-crafted plots  3-dimensional characters  and the best film music since...well...ever. This film just doesn't come close.  Might as well start w/ the positive aspects  though. Like all Miyazaki films  this one is still very imaginative  with a bizarre fantasy/sci-fi setting  in a post-apocalyptic world where insects are the dominant species. Nausicaa can also boast some far superior animation to other films from its time. (though not as beautiful and fluid as Miyazaki's later films) And the English voice acting is quite well done.  But this film...just...isn't...good... The characters are all cardboard - from saccharine sweet little Nausicaa  to the ruthlessly evil Tolmekians  to everyone in between. Once you've seen each of them for 30 seconds  you've seen all there is. And the fact that the plot just ambles along doesn't help.  Then there's the music... Now  Hisaichi is hands down my favorite film composer  but Nausicaa doesn't do him justice. Half the music is 80's keyboards on overdrive  and it usually enters and leaves so abruptly that it distracts the visuals rather than helping them. I highly suspect that Hisaichi was told to compose a lot of the music before he even saw the picture.  But wait! There's a great message with this film  right?! Let's all save the environment! Too bad that this film hits you over the head with it like a sledgehammer. There is a scene in which Nausicaa hugs a tree. No  really. I ain't kidding.  It makes me a little sad to talk about how lame this film is. But for some reason all the other reviews on IMDb seem to adore it. And when the characters have to talk to themselves in extended sentences to tell you what's going on  that's lame.  If you're the kind of person who worships anime  enjoys 80's music  and plants a tree every Arbor day  you will probably like this film. Otherwise  save your money for his later films  because they rock big time.\n",

      "If I had never seen the first Road House  then I guess this movie might get one more star  but even then that makes it a 3 star movie. For that matter I was really surprised as to the relatively high rating it currently has.  In reality  I was not able to finish this movie  as it was painful. Where it went wrong (at least the most obvious way) is that it pretty much parallels the original exactly even though the original plot is still referenced. This doesn't really make sense and doesn't work. Also  the acting is weak...I never felt like I was into the movie yet I felt like I was watching people act. Even good actors like Busey don't work out  probably due to the screenplay or maybe the awkward editing. The strangest thing is that the movie feels like a mid 90's B movie  yet is made in 06. I am not sure as to why  but then again  this often seems to happen with sequels for some reason. The music  the look  and the whole overall feel reminds me of movies you saw 10 years ago on Cinemax late at night. The strangest thing of all is that I am also expecting Ja Rule to come in at some point...often it reminds me of more current movies with rappers as actors.  The most irritating thing is love interest girl who's character seems like a total rip off of the Lois Lane character on Smallville which is also quite annoying. And lets not forget the fakest sounding southern accents I have heard since Walk the Line. I realize this is common place in movies  but no accent at all would work better than attempting to sound like you are from that universal hick place on TV where anyone from any southern state (or KY and WV) sound exactly the same. Sure  people in desert towns in AZ sound just like people in Southeastern states 2000+ miles away. That was wearing thin 10 years ago in the B movies where technique came from. Why do writers / directors make such decisions?   Bottom line: I would truly not recommend this if you are a fan of Road House or if you like good movies. Also  if you have not seen it yet  don't spoil it by seeing this version first. The original Road House was one of those accidental classics that people love and watch over and over. It was an unexpected success like American Graffiti  Dazed and Confused  and more recently Office Space  Fast and Furious (only the first one!)  and Napolean Dynamite. Why did they spoil it!!!???  They should have never made a sequel to Road House other than a high budget version with the right actors / director. Sure  you can never top the original (ex: Bad News Bears  The Longest Yard  etc.)  but at least if you can do it right it will be presentable as is the case with the examples I mentioned. But to make a low budget  off-network  self production of Road House is criminal.\n",

Bill Macy (as Oscar Payne) is good in a part that would have been played by John Karlen (in a Dan Curtis production).  There are smooth cameos by Joan Blondell  John Carradine  and Dorothy Lamour. Ms. Lamour's delivery resembles Joan Bennett  which begs the question: why didn't producer Aaron Spelling get more of the original Dark Shadows regulars?   Director E.W. Swackhamer was Bridget Hanley's husband; he worked with Ms. Blondell on Here Come the Brides  and with Jackson on The Rookies. Death at Love House has  arguably  a tighter storyline than the Night of Dark Shadows film; it differs in the movie star angle; and  in its Father Eternal Fire ending  it more closely resembles the TVseries' Laura the Phoenix storyline.   **** Death at Love House (9/3/76) E.W.

      "If I could have given this film 0/10 I would  and this is the first film I have wanted to rate so low. Its worse than awful. If I went to see it in the cinema I would want the cinema to pay ME for watching it (at least minimum wage). Some of the camera shots were quite effective  but a lot were rubbish eg. villains reflection in a mirror that separates his head and shoulders side-ways from his body (seeing is believing). Several totally pointless killings of innocent civilians. 2 murders that made me laugh out loud due to the victims actions/facial expressions when they were shot. I only watched it to the end (fast forwarding about 10 mins of the boring pointless dialogue) hoping to see Seagal in some decent hand to hand combat  but there was almost none of that (should have known that when at the beginning he threw someone while going down an elevator and it was shown in slow motion with music - end of 'action' scene). In one scene we see Seagal hand chop someones neck in slow motion which makes it obvious that his hand never even made contact). The chief villain keeps coming back to life. He gets shot in the chest on 2 separate occasions. The 1st time its with a shotgun which blows him out the 2nd/3rd floor onto the street. To sum up  this film is a total waste of time and a total joke. It looks very low budget (even for Seagal). The colour is dull and grey. I could go on and on....just like this film  but I wont. Watch this film if you've got insomnia. Its guaranteed to put you to sleep.\n",

The film is pure drivel  the acting cardboard  the dialogue ridiculous & the ending just flat!

The movie was relevant to me since I lived in Estonia when these events took place  but it is written horribly and fails to capture the attention of someone who knows nothing on the matter. The music choices do not flow well with the movie  it seems as if someone just turned a CD player on in the background to put the actors in the mood. The acting... well  what acting? The only people acting are Jürgen Prochnow and Donald Sutherland  even though Prochnow seems uncomfortable in this role. As far as the relationship development goes between Erik Westermark (Jürgen Prochnow) and Julia Reuter (Greta Scacchi)  it is like watching a train wreck. There is absolutely no chemistry and it is painful to witness their sincere moments. This is not a good movie. There is a difference between trying to get a message out (could've been a documentary!) and trying to make a good movie. This is a failure and anyone here who says otherwise makes me wonder if they are trying to promote it. As a matter of fact  as a native of Estonia I am offended by this miserable effort. This tragedy deserves more than just a homemade low-budget ghost chase excuse of a movie. This could have been much more!\n",

      "I keep waiting for Peter Fonda to start acting. For someone who comes from such a talented family  it's a mystery to me why Peter Fonda can only play Peter Fonda trying to play someone else. And  that's the good news in this disappointing dog of an adaptation of The Tempest. A string of loosely connected ideas that only suggest a relationship with the Bard's great play is what we're served. The setting is the Civil War and Prospero's (here Guideon's) evil brother looks like an 1890's melodrama villain  complete with Snidely Whiplash moustache. I kept waiting for him to go Uh ha hah! which would have been a high point in this dreary presentation. None of the supporting cast was memoriable and Peter Fonda's lack of expression and wooden body movements made the lackadaisical story drag on and on.   The Tempest is the Bard's statement about the rage of man's unjust treatment of man. The only believable character was the Gator man  the Caliban counterpart. The transferrence to the swamp had possibilities but the Civil War setting just didn't make it. All in all  a very disappointing production. I saw it on video and would advise  if you want a Willy Shakespeare fix  save your money on this one. Rent something else  like Branagh's Much Ado about Nothing  or Kevin Kline in Midsummer's Night Dream.\n",

      "This is one of the most awful movies I've ever seen  probably only surpassed by the dreadful and utterly meaningless Blueberry. How can Harald Zwart even have put his name on this crap. I'm feeling every ounce of respect I had for him waning fast.  So what is it about this film that makes it so poor? Is it the story? Yes. Is it the actors? Yes. It it the whole look and feel of the movie? Yes.  To start off with the story  my god!It's about as cliché-ridden and predictable as what you would expect from a drunk 14-year old who is late writing his/her paper on What I did this summer. The feel-good vibe the makers try to achieve just completely drown as we suffer through yet another embarrassing turn to the story.  The actors are amateurs  I know  and thus we cannot expect them to be of the same quality as professional actors. But for this to work  the characters HAVE to be charming and/or funny (preferably both)  so that the viewers don't mind the cheeky acting  or perhaps it even adds to the characters. In this case  not even close baby! You start off disliking the characters mildly  and by the end of the film (I think it's about 90 minutes long  although it feels like 4 hours) you have a strong desire to hurt somebody to get your mind of these annoying stupid guys! It should be impossible to find this movie's attempt at humor successful unless you're actually yourself like these stupid hickeys. Their before mentioned lack of talent and credibility as far as acting goes  only makes the foolish and overly simple scenes fall harder to the ground. Even the family of the people involved will have a hard time finding this anything but very  very embarrassing (I'd rather have my sister make a fool of herself on American Idol).  Finally  why cram in a bunch of misplaced Norwegian celebrities? They look even more out of place than the actors  if this is possible. These celebrity cameos just add to the cheap feeling of the film and is in itself a pretty see-through shot in the dark at trying to improve something broken even before inception.  I cannot even begin to stress how much I'd rather watch paint dry than ever watch this movie again...\n",

      "Art-house horror tries to use unconventional aesthetics to cover the fact that this is just another serial killer chiller which ultimately relies on pornographic combinations of teen sexuality and violent gore. The suburbs come across about as well as they do in every piece of Australian writing (book or film) since 1960 - surprise surprise  the suburbs have a dark underbelly - and the plot is as contrived as any you've seen. The neighbours would never know about this guy  one of the filmmakers says about Joel Edgerton's character. But he was completely plausible as to what he was. Serial killers don't all have patches over their eyes and scars down their cheeks. They look like the guy next door. Another trader in pornographic violence who sees a serial killer in every street. But the real insignificance of this film is in the fact that it's a genre film that nobody saw. Backed by substantial funds (including some from Film Finance - that's government)  this got a run at the Underground Film Festival in Melbourne and had to rely on ACMI kindness for a *very* short release season. Q1: What is the FFC doing funding genre flicks  even if they are 'arty' and aesthetically unconventional? Q2: Why are these nasty movies (ACOLYTES; BEAUTIFUL; PUNISHMENT; NO THROUGH ROAD) being made in the first place? Richard Wolstencroft & co encourage their creators to believe they're giving the masses what they really want  as opposed to what the culture elite in government funding think they want. The truth is that these brutal and forgettable nasties earn far more critical acclaim - and win far more obscure awards - than they're due.\n",

      "This movie has good intentions  at least in the message don't be afraid  no matter how tough it can be. Fear will kill you in the end It's a good message  but the container is so flawed that the message gets squashed by bad acting  complete lack of credibility in the feelings  dialog that's delivered as if it were read out loud  stereotypes instead of breathing  living people.  It abuses from effects such as slow-motion to compensate for a complete lack of credibility in the acting and thus  a lack of emotional force...  The suicidal part of it still reminds me of a low-budget film from the pre-90s  when lesbians seemed to have (at least on celluloid) an utter incapacity of live good  happy lives  and a tendency to get caught in over-the-top dramas that often involved separation  death  or prison.   Had it focused on the rewards of living life according to how we feel it (and not according to how others think we should live it)  it would have being less dramatic  more inspiring. But it doesn't  it focuses of pain  on loss and leaves the message at just a theoretical ideal.  I can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.   If you're looking for a really good movie that talks about overcoming fear and daring to live what you feel  go back to the magnificent Desert Hearts (even better: read the novel!)\n",

I'm not sure what is more horrendous; the violence  the sexual perverseness  the acting or the plot (or severe lack thereof).  The two and a half hours basically follows the ascension of the infamous Roman Caesar Caligula to to throne in 37AD and shows the atrocities and perverseness he supposedly committed whilst in power. The acting is lifeless and dull - but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Obviously knowing that this film was severely lacking of anything legitimately interesting  the directors decided to throw in as much nudity and orgy scenes as was conceivably possible. But don't be fooled  these scenes don't ease or take focus away from the hideousness of this film. The camera work is shoddy  dialog is laughable in fact you'd have to congratulate Malcolm McDowell (playing Caligula) for keeping a straight face through such farcical lines. And then there's the violence....  If you are about to see the film be prepared. Some atrocities are committed in the film (not just through the writing) but through disgusting violent acts which are of little point or purpose other than to repulse the viewer. This is only objective this movie achieved. One must wonder how the makers of this film thought that bestiality  necrophilia and castration (just to name a few) would be appealing to anyone. When it belatedly ends after two and a half hours you take nothing from this film other than some disturbing images and the knowledge that you may have witnessed the worst film ever.

      " unlucky. These are the films that obviously thrived on a lot of goodwill and a handful of potentially great ideas  but simply didn't have the budgetary means and/or professional cast and crew members at their disposal to make it happen. The Strangeness definitely belongs in this category. You really want to like it  but even the most tolerant and undemanding 80's horror fanatics will have to admit the film barely reaches the level of mediocrity due to its atmosphere of cheapness  clumsy stop-motion effects and impenetrably dark cinematography. The Strangeness has a fairly original plot and setting (okay  it's similar to The Boogens but I sincerely doubt that director David Michael Hillman intentionally ripped off a fellow insignificant 80's B-movie) and the players deliver enthusiast performances even though they're all miscast. An assembly of amateur speleologists go on an expedition to explore the infamous Gold Spike mine. Many years ago  several miners mysteriously died there and the place has abandoned ever since  but there's supposed to be too much gold hidden there to remain closed forever. Shortly after they descended into the mine  the group members one by one encounter the slimy ruler of the Gold Spike mine; a Lovecraftian monster with tentacles and an incredibly cheesy way of moving forward. Throughout most of its running time  The Strangeness is a boring and incompetent mess that is difficult to follow due to the complete lack of lighting. The characters are uninteresting and the mine remains a mystery because the only lighting effects come from the helmets of the speleologists. There's very little action or horror to experience in the first hour  but director Hillman cleverly grasps the viewers' attention by showing bits and pieces of the monster at regular intervals. As soon as you catch the first glimpse of the monster's tentacle  you're doomed to keep watching till the very end. The creature is realized with stop-motion effects  which I usually adore and worship  but here in this case they look extremely weak and pitiable. The person responsible for the special effects should have paid more attention to the work of Ray Harryhousen. The death sequences largely occur off-screen and there's very little suspense throughout the whole movie. A horror flick with a setting like this should benefice from claustrophobic atmosphere and unidentifiable sound effects  but The Strangeness lacks all this. The biggest trump of the film is unquestionably the beautiful appearance of blond actress Terri Berland. She resembles a speleologist as much as I resemble Mother Theresa  but she surely looks good in her tight white top and beige pants.\n",

Okay  the plot idea has potential; but I got the feeling that half the episode was just filler  and the other half was actually important to the story.

The character who left the other behind  Brett  came across as being overly innocent and naive  the one left behind walked around talking in this monotone and robotic voice.

That aside  this film is also profoundly disturbing in that it justifies the manipulative and psychotic machinations of a character that is profoundly disturbed. If you've seen any of the promotional material  you might think this is a poignant film about a relationship that's reached its end  but none of that suggests how really disturbing the central premise is:  A woman threatens suicide unless her soon to be ex agrees to relive here most treasured memories of their relationship. When told how unfair (to say the least) that such a threat is  Tessa (the purported protagonist) suggests that life's not fair.  Huh??? This character also uses tears to manipulate her former lover into staying  and coaxes him into sexually oriented behavior (which she initially denies as a motive) all the while assuring him this isn't sex.

      "Once upon a time there was a great American film. Which combined horror and comedy with equal thrills. This film featured clever direction. Groundbreaking special effects and superb comedic and serious acting. It was entitled 'An American Werewolf in London.' Sixteen years later the long awaited sequel was finally pinned onto the poster board outside your local theater. Surely it would have at least some of the thrills of the original. Think again. 'An American Werewolf in Paris' is an incomprehensible mess from start to pitiful finish. The problems begin with the leading man. Tom Everett Scott's performance is stiff and tiresome. From the outset he seems intent on proving that all young people are simpletons. In his defense  not even a seasoned Shakespearean thespian could have extracted a good performance from the juvenile and witless dialogue. At one point  one of Scott's deceased friends  who's soul is doomed to walk the Earth after being carved up by one of the werewolves  Is finally able to leave for the afterlife. He then quips to Scott and his friends. 'Okay guys  see ya.' What a memorable goodbye. Julie Delphy soon shows up as Scott's mysterious European love interest. Basically  she's a French girl playing the French girl. It isn't much of a stretch. But all this stupidity isn't even the most disappointing thing about the film. The special effects  such an integral part of the superb original film  fall far short in this flop. The werewolves look like cartoons. And no matter how well you sculpt a cartoon with sinewy lycanthrope muscles. It's still hard to get scared of a cartoon. So instead the vacationing American gang  led by the ultra weak Scott  keep finding excuses to return to the werewolf's catacombs lair. Here it's much easier for this incompetent special effects crew to keep the computer enhanced creatures or absurd beast masks under the cover of darkness. Some have said that if you don't look on this film as a sequel it's not as bad by comparison. I disagree  this film can not stand on its own  and is even more of a disgrace when compared to the brilliant original. If it doesn't want to be looked on as a sequel it should not have borrowed most of the title from the 1981 film. I   don't care how much you love werewolves. Or how much you worshiped 'American Werewolf in London.' as I myself did. This one is simply not worth wasting your time. 'Okay guys  see ya.' Terrible. 3 out of a possible 10 T.H.\n",

I went see Nouvelle-France expecting a journey in the lives of my ancestors  but i found myself stuck in a pool of inconsistencies: french accent (we gotta please our cousins  so f*** our québecois' language)and lack of historical research is only a few. Add a campy love story and the same music score playing again and again and dumb québecois' viewer is gonna open up and ask for more. I'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained movie business of Québec.  Rent Cruising Bar instead and have a real good time.  PS: I'll never forgive them for ruining such an awesome title.\n",

      "i bought this rental return for $1.99 at hollywood and overpaid. i didn't expect much  but thought it would be something to fall asleep by at least. i quickly noted the very weak storyline  the gross overacting by everyone (no one talks like that except in cartoons)  and the seemingly let's-make-it-up-as-we-go-along direction. i know that the participants in this mess must be very embarrassed by it  and i feel certain that it did not help any careers. as for this movie buff of 35 years  it has now provided a ready answer for the worst-film-you've-ever-seen question.  \n",

      "The first 1/3 of this movie I loved and thought it was going to be one of Truffaut's best films. I loved the plot where a pen pal marries a man from half way around the world--sight unseen. Especially when this woman turns out to be a fraud and was responsible for the death of the REAL pen pal so she could take her place! She then cleaned out the husband's huge bank account and disappeared! I was really hooked and wanted to see more ...  And then  the movie fell apart and became just plain dumb! Despite her coming from New Caladonia (an island in the Pacific) and he from Reunion (an island in the Indian Ocean)  when he goes on a trip to the South of France  he stumbles upon her almost immediately. Hmm ....odds are 187 000 000 to 1 but he finds her. Then  instead of either killing her or turning her over to the police  he forgives her--even when she acknowledges what she has done. Okay--this is tough to believe  but okay ...but then he helps to hide her from a private detective by murdering him!!!! No one is that stupid! Yes  the character Catherine Deneuve plays is quite beautiful but come on folks--this is just silly. Plus  if he only wanted her as a sex object  then why would he do this for a woman who is often frigid and completely selfish and evil.  This movie  due to it's very ridiculous plot  does not deserve such high ratings! Unless you are a die-hard Truffaut fan  try another film--even one of Truffaut's--just NOT this one.\n",

      "Once a month  I invite a few friends over for a Retarded Movie Night. We look forward to movies that are either so bad they're funny or movies that know they don't have a plot and just show a lot of chests. Last night  we were unfortunate enough to have Zombie Planet as one of our movies. The cinematography is on par with what we're used to  but the acting was a different story. The lead role is played by a Johnny Depp/Rob Zombie wanna-be who couldn't get a role in a high school play  let alone a LOW-BUDGET horror film. Our indecisive hero  who couldn't tell whether or not he wanted to be a bad-ass this scene or a whimpering coward was one of the reasons why this was the first movie of 30 that I have ever had to stop early during a Retarded Movie Night. It had the possibility for greatness with a GREAT twist on the standard zombie infection  but they took it an entirely different direction based on Johnny Zombie. I personally would not recommend this to any of my friends. However  it's unfortunate that I already invited a few over last night to suffer through 80% of this movie with me.\n",

Watching the movie  we honestly were able to complete about half of the one-dimensional characters' lines and thoughts. I realize this was supposedly adapted from a book  but was the book this bad?

      "Well  I didn't know what to expect from 555. Matter of fact  I had never even heard of it until a few months ago. But  being a collector of just about all types of horror I figured I would go ahead and grab this obscure 80's slasher.  Basically the storyline has to do with a killer that kills every 5 years for 5 nights in a row. What the third 5 in the title means... nobody knows. Anyway  the killings start as the killer searches for young teenagers fooling around in obscure places. He decapitates the men and brutally knifes the woman to death. After this  he proceeds to rape the dead corpse. The police think they have a lead on the killings but really have no idea what is going on. How will they find the killer? Does anybody care?  This movie is filled with some of the worst actors I have ever seen. No wonder none of these actors went on to do anything else  literally. The three lead actors consist of two detectives and a sexy female reporter. I am being sarcastic when I say sexy  she is about as un-sexy as it gets. The two detectives are like watching tweedle dee and tweedle dum. One of them underacts his part and the other one may have gone to the Shatner School of Acting. The acting is so bad that it almost forces you to lose your interest in the movie  thus almost putting you to sleep.  The only thing holding this terrible movie together is a few decent gore scenes. For a movie on this budget the makers must have put all of there money into the special effects  which still aren't that great.  Unless you are like me and have to own every single horror movie out there  I would suggest steering clear of this movie. 4/10\n",

      "The kind of B-movies from the 1950's that were schlocky yet so much fun are to what Predator Island pays homage. Filmed in Connecticut  Predator Island is set on an island called with a lighthouse Hell's Beacon which is inhabited by only the couple who tends the lighthouse. In typical 1950's sci-fi fashion after a half dozen young adults crash their boat into the island's rocky shore hideous creatures from outer space invade the island after a meteor hits nearby. The creatures start both inhabiting the bodies of their victims as well as devouring them. Lots of cursing and lame comebacks are the primary form of dialogue in this movie. It is so hokey that you just have to laugh at times. If you are looking for a movie that is stupid  but in a fun way  then this one fits the bill.   Interesting note: I appear in the film as a dead body in the far background of the final scene. During filming they needed about 50 extras  yet around 300 people showed up for the opportunity. They eventually used nearly 200 of them.\n",

The story is very slow and never really reaches anything worth getting excited about.  The patients at the asylum are embarrassingly funny especially Sam and the old woman who always quotes an old saying to everyone. (Look out for the bit when she gets close to the camera  tell me you can watch without laughing!).  Now the gore is very poor looking  with the blood looking pink in many scenes so it doesn't really deserve its place on the video nasties list!.

The intro to the movie is quite possibly the worst intro to a horror film I have ever seen  I mean a angry chick hitting a guy in the head with a frying pan isn't at all frightening which is what I assume the director was aiming for  but in fact it was mildly funny.   The acting in this picture was beyond pathetic; a note to directors  if your making a horror film  please hire some good actors  not some popular teen soap star who has no idea how to act.  The death scenes in this movie were beyond boring... no gore  and i'm sorry but horror movies without gore  or good suspense are just cheesy. I mean this girl gets killed by hair wrapped all around her in the middle of Tokyo  and not one person sees it happen  they just declare her as missing  wow thats awesome!  In conclusion if you and your friends want to see this movie  make sure u bring some sleeping pills  because I guarantee you won't make it to the end..

      "It amazes me that someone would actually consider spending some money on a movie like this. Really. Let's forget for a second that the plot doesn't even give a single hint of originality... Most of the movies today are based on other movies' stories  so a simple lack of originality is not that big a deal.   But I can hardly believe that none of the guys involved in the movie had never even got on a plane before shooting this. Because  let's be honest  that would be the only excuse to come up with something so ridiculous. To be sincere I think a 6-years-old child with a fake camera could have come up with something technically much more believable. Some examples following.  The scene that really drove me crazy is when the engines turn off when they regain control of the plane. When they have to turn them on again the guy on the radio says something like Ok  push the 1 and 2 buttons on the dashboard. Now  those are not buttons. They should not be pushed  they should actually be pulled up and toward the pilot. That's something only plane-addicted would know  you say? Wrong. The next scene you can see their fingers pushing the buttons... And of course the so called buttons don't move at all! Not even a single millimeter! (And note that I haven't even mentioned the fact that aircraft engines are not like cars engine  that you just turn the key and the magic happens... You have to do quite a complicated procedure to turn them on...) Come on guys! You could have faked the movements at least!! Not to mention the hilarious final impact  where the plane crashes against every single thing along the runway (Light poles along the runway? What where they thinking?!)... And the wings don't even get ripped off! It happened to me too  once... Except the plane was made of Lego! What about the flight attendant? She's actually so skilled that she perfectly knows where the aux 1 and aux 2 fuses are  in the middle of the wires behind the cockpit. Should we mention  then  the guy that can drive an ambulance _and_ fly a plane behind the ambulance using his computer? And how did he turn the other airplane engines on?  Really  I could go on hours with this stuff. This is the dumbest movie I've ever come across  and I'm including garbage like Alone In The Dark and other stuff in the list.

      "Oh  my. Oh  this is a *really* bad movie. The acting is absolutely atrocious  the script is god-awful  and the photography is simply dreadful.  What does make this movie stand out  however  is that you never once care about a single soul-- good guy or bad guy  living  dying or dead-- in the entire 87 minutes. Oh  s/he died? Huh... Figured they would was the best reaction I could muster after each murder. Characters are so black-or-white that with the volume turned off  you could still figure out who was who. While the cast's voices had an odd monotone quality throughout  their faces give the impression that you're looking at an old silent movie with a lot of eyebrow waggling  exaggerated frowns and pensive looks. Each character is a humorless  passionless  one-dimensional one-trick pony; once they fulfill whatever their particular role in this fiasco demanded their creation  they are summarily dismissed.  It vaguely made me think of what would happen if Thomas Borch Nielsen (director/writer of Skyggen  American title: Webmaster) decided to do a low-budget version of American Psycho and got kind of distracted along the way.  This isn't a particularly gruesome movie; the cold  passionless cast ensures that. It isn't an offensive movie; the director plays it so safe that no one could possibly find it so. It is  simply and after all  a bad movie.  Avoid it. We were not so fortunate and actually paid to watch this bomb on Pay-per-View. As part of my penance  I'm writing this review.  Enough said.\n",

      "Recap: Not entirely familiar with the Shakespeare story of Macbeth  but my wild guess is that this is pretty close to the original  only set in present time. It tells the story of Macbeth  a member of a crime syndicate in Melbourne (?). He is a valued hit-man and in the favor of leader Duncan. But he and his lady has higher ambitions than that  and plan the murder of Duncan  and any competition of the throne. This is a story of betrayal and cold  brutal death.  Comments: Very interesting idea  I must say. To use the story but change the setting to present time  but still keep the original (?) dialog. It sets a huge contrast between the classical poetic work and the violence. Promised to be extremely violent  it is a promise that it keeps  but not in the notion I imagined. It is very bloody indeed  but the violence is slow. Not just figuratively speaking that it is calculated  which it is too  but also literally. A lot of action is actually slowed down to slow motion and that is what brings the movie to its knees.  What could have been a unique strength  the contrast between the superfluous and poetic dialog and the extreme violence  now turns into something else entirely. Now both slow the move down painfully much  so much that it actually becomes dull and boring at times.  Also I can't figure out the context the three witches act within. Set to present time and reality I figure that such magical witchcraft had no place in the movie. Apparently it does  but to me it seems completely out of place. Not a subplot but a complete sub-story with it's own rules  completely different than the rest of the movie. Seems completely out of place. Surely it must have been possible to convert that part too to something modern. Drug-induced hallucinations perhaps (which I suspect that the director hints at but then he has left way too much witchcraft in it to be believable)? Now they only bring stretches of the movie that is clearly beside the story and I just waited for the real movie to begin again.  A clear disappointment  but maybe something for Shakespearean-buffs?  4/10\n",

      "Lil Pimp is the story of a little boy who becomes a pimp. The animation and voice acting were perfect for this type of film.  I laughed out loud for the first 20 minutes or so of this movie; mostly at the concept. After that  the joke wore thin. As a 15-20 minute animated short  Lil Pimp would have been a classic. Instead  this movie consists entirely of one joke that lasts far too long.  Weathers  voiced by Ludicrous  does have several crude and funny one-liners. Unfortunately  that is all the boy's pet rat is good for as he contributes nothing else to the story. Eventually  I grew as bored with his remarks as I did the rest of this movie.  I am a big fan of South Park  and other animation aimed at adults. I also play several online pimp games  so I am partial to stories about pimps. The transition from little boy to lil pimp was brilliant; but after that  both the story and dialog became redundant and predictable.  I give this movie a five. It is worth watching for the great concept and voice acting. Just do not expect much else or you will be quite disappointed.\n",

I never actually was planning on watching this but it started poking at my curiosity and i finally decided to pop in it the DVD player. The effects in this movie are horrible and cheap. Some of the dialog in this movie sounds like it was written by a swear happy 12 year old boy. The acting is really cheesy in some parts  and the action scenes are completely laughable. You'll burst out laughing at some parts which was a positive for me because it kept me mildly entertained. The plot is some girl has a curse on her which causes her to vomit snakes so some shaman has to get her to Los Angeles  there are also two girls trying to smuggle drugs there and a few other people that are unimportant to the plot  not that there really is a plot at all.Don't expect anything from this movie and don't listen to the cover  there are not 100 passengers and 3 000 vipers  there are 10 passengers and 20 random snakes.  As for the DVD  there is a trailer which is almost as laughable as the film  a blooper reel which is just one shot over and over of one actor trying to say train  and the deleted scenes are really pointless  if they weren't good enough to stay in this movie they must be pretty bad. There is also a really bad making of featurette which doesn't really show much at all except that the people involved with this movie were kind of idiots.

Possibly the worst scene came early in the movie when he broke into a spontaneous song and dance number centered around a piano and some conveniently placed employees. The song was totally stupid... I think I could drunkenly offer a few lines on a sheet of paper that would far exceed it and probably win a Grammy. Then  as if the writers could come up with no better way to escape the ridiculousness of the scene  Fischer says something to the effect of  Don't tell (insert the guy's name). He doesn't like music and smiles. I can't describe how bad this is  I felt a little embarrassed. And that guy Debbie Reynolds works with and who's always hitting on her is so annoying too. I can't even imagine someone like her wasting a fraction of time on him. The jokes were delivered without any sort of chemistry between characters which made the movie crawl by.

If you can get past the weak plot  the cheesy effects and the uninspired acting  then the horrible writing will kill you  or you'll wish it would.

      "I was thrilled by the fresh (pun intended) synopsis of this film and looking forward to watch it. The first few shots introduce some of the characters as well as the main location where the stories take place; the gardening allotments. The movie looks fantastic. Colorful yet simple. Magical yet genuine. Unfortunately  it only takes a few minutes to figure out where the movie will go. We quickly figure out this will be a manipulative  sappy tale illustrating a bunch of jaded people set in their ways confronted by nice victimized refugees and that it will have a happy ending where the jaded people realize the error of their ways and accept these people.   The characters  particularly the prejudiced ones  are very comic-booky in nature. The story focuses mainly on two refugee families. One of them is headed by a single mom played atrociously by Diveen Henry. I am saddened to say that any emotion that might have been felt toward her struggles were defused by what was memorably bad acting.  The other story is much more interesting and focuses on a father and his two children. All are scarred by their journey to this country by way of containers  where the wife and mother died but it is the husband who suffers the most. Benedict Wong gives a mind-blowing performance here. At first  his emotions are very subdued but as the story develops  he subtly makes us aware of the inner-struggles of his character.   Unfortunately  the rest of the movie is just extremely boring. There were so many possibilities with this movie. There are several characters to keep track of  many of which might have potential but none of it is realized. Even worse  despite this movie being very much not Hollywoodian  some of the main plot threads are solved cheaply in a Hollywood b-grade way. Example:  Character A likes character B Character B rejects his advances No problem! Let's have character C declare her love for character A so we can all have a happy ending. Yawn.   I liked very much the plot thread of the Asian family. That was well done. Unfortunately  the whole allotment business  the communal aspect of it  the dynamic involving a large cast are all under exploited.  What you're left with is a movie that has very little worth.\n",

I can't say I expected better from Will Smith  but I definitely did from Kevin James of The King of Queens-- but  hey  I'm getting used to saying that a lot lately. This film attempts to make its mark as a witty romantic comedy  but it never hits the bull's-eye. In fact  it never hits *anywhere* within the target. The allergy scene is disturbing; the fact that Kevin James can't dance is something that wouldn't exactly catch anybody off-guard  and is therefore (in a movie like this) not funny.

You remember him  don't you? He was the guy that lied on the stand and gave the OJ Simpson defense a foothold they were looking for. Well  he has written three books since then. I have read all three of them. No  I am not a fan  they were given to me. HOWEVER  I will tell you one similarity in all three  they grossly distort the importance of Mark Furhman. He shamelessly exaggerates his stature in all three. In Murder in Spokane  he pretends that he had something to do with catching the killer  when he had nothing to do with it. In all books he takes great delight in running down local law enforcement efforts. Kind of like his efforts were run down in the OJ trial. In this movie  there are plenty of slow motion shots of ladies looking at Furhman and lusting after him. Many other shots have him at the center of attention  when in reality  I am sure the only thing people were thinking at the time was hey  isn't that the racist that caused OJ to get off? This was an interesting real life story  but not a good movie over it.\n",

      "Michael Myers  the deranged  not-so-young-anymore psycho  who seems to get beefier with every appearance  is resurrected by his druid brothers to wreck more menace upon his family members  and any one else who gets in the way. Gaps in logic seem to be ignored in favor of a healthy body count. Michael  who originally preferred strangulations and kitchen knives  learns to swing an axe and use whatever means necessary to off his victims  and the result is an awful  patchwork  dollar store film virtually unhelped by a few genuinely creepy sequences. Donald Pleasance  who died shortly after production  seems to have been injected into this story simply so *somebody* could be billed as the star. You won't want to cover your eyes during this one  but you will shake your head at the downward slide of John Carpenter's classic creation.\n",

      "Crash is overwrought  over-thought and over-baked. A great example of how to make a pompous and self-important film with a message. Haggis tries too hard to make his point and overreaches in just about every category of the film. It feels very much in love with its own sense of social relevance and has all the subtlety of a jackhammer to the skull. Sure  race relations affect everyone and there's a great deal of ambiguity to the issue  but the universe of 'Crash' operates to suggest that we are all victims to our own perceptions on race. It's a tiresome thread that repeats itself ad nauseum and wears out its welcome within the first 30 minutes. I found the outcomes of the characters unsurprising and forced and the film took forever to sputter out and die. The fact that this film is in the top 50 movies on IMDb is a testament to the public's willingness to get suckered by Hollywood malarkey.  Indeed  if you want the real Crash  go check out the one by David Cronenberg: dark  twisted and original. This film plays as preachy  tiresome  and masochistic.\n",

      "This was not a good film. Poorly scripted and acted - the concept was not new  the effects poor and not a showcase for Arnold Vosloo who really is a half decent actor. I watched this under some protest and only remembered having seen it before towards the very end - it's that forgettable. The acting seemed to consist of a number of glares & looks devoid of any sincerity. I kept expecting this to actually get going and before long I was just hoping it would finish. As for the medical bits - well I wasn't expecting a true version of ER events but this was just comical - I am a Dr so know what I am taking about - and the operative bits were just plain silly.  Do not waste your valuable time - unless you have absolutely nothing else to do - go out  ring up a long lost friend  watch paint dry  sort out your sock draw  do some household task.

      "If you really loved GWTW  you will find quite disappointing the story. Those who may think this is just about a romantic story and the south  will be probably satisfied with this decent TV production (altought I consider an important miscast the choice for Scarlett). But  let me say that considering the novel  nothing good could came out of this.  I've read GWTW more than 20 times and I can really appreciate the adaptation Mrs. Mitchell did for the film. It took me some time to understand how good the ending was: Scarlett knew for sure she was going to recover Rhett  since she always got what she wanted. But there was no kiss in the end.  Then Alexandra Ripley came to fix this by showing us exactly how perfect and mighty Scarlett could be  and of course  describing in detail how exactly she gets Rhett back even when she had an important affair with someone else (nothing could have been further from Mrs. Mitchell mind  I am sure).  The story between these points is in my opinion just a long and boring ride made up to tie ends  showing off costumes and scenarios just to give us an obvious and totally unnecessary ending.  If Margaret Mitchell could came to live again  she would die one more time at the very moment she'd find out what Scarlett became after GWTW.  Sure it's not fair to compare this to the original but this is not GWTW fault. Isn't it? Is it any good if I don't compare it to the original? Maybe. Sorry to say I don't really care.  I would expect little more compromise to continue someone else's (suberb) work  otherwise don't even try.\n",

      "Ray Bradbury  run and hide! This tacky film version of his short story from the 1950s about time travel and the effect it might have on de-evolution is not well known from the theatrical run (did it have one?) and exists now as a DVD on the shelves released during a slow week.  What looks to be a fancy sci-fi thriller form the opening scenes quickly fools us as the computer generated graphics are re-run unaltered throughout a film that is supposed to be about different 'trips' back in time where a major company sells macho guys in 2055 the chance to hunt dinosaurs by paying exorbitant fees to travel back in time to prehistoric jungles. One slip of the foot/butterfly while on one of these ventures and the course of evolution is altered with resultant time waves rolling over the planet changing everything to man-eating plants and beasties. Of course there is a pretty damsel who knows how to reverse the process and a hunky man to risk his life to act on her orders and everything is eventually OK.  Yes  that is the story...and the most surprising fact about this poorly scripted  abysmally acted mess of a film is that it attracted some fine talent to portray the comic book flat characters. Edward Burns (all buff and hunky) is our hero du jour  Ben Kingsley is the requisite bad corporate guy sporting a ridiculous white wig  Catherine McCormack is the know-it-all woman creator  and Wilfried Hochholdinger as an evil one - all are superb actors and should have known better than to align with this flop. And the saddest thing is that for those who like this genre of sci-fi monster thrillers the creative department sold out with some of the corniest animation to hit the screen in a long time.

When you consider what was achieved in 1933 with the original King Kong  you've got to ask yourself why anyone would stoop so low as to produce this debacle. Then  taking it one step further and realizing that the quantum leap to Star Wars the following year achieved a new level in sci-fi entertainment  this offering will make you laugh and cry at the same time.  Now let me ask you  what would possess the Professor (Peter Cushing) to bring along an umbrella as a prime piece of subterranean research equipment for the ride to the earth's core? OK  so it was useful in fending off the parrot/tyrannosaur (parrotosaurus?) in the early going  but come on.

He probably didn't have Caroline Munro in mind either as Princess Dia  probably the only redeeming factor to this whole escapade.

      "Terrible  boring zombie sequel is only marginally better than Uwe's horrible first film. It consists of a group of soldiers going into a zombie plagued college campus to find a certain type of blood which could assist in finding a cure for the infection. These soldiers are your typical lambs to the slaughter and none of them are that drawn out(or at least aren't very interesting)so you don't feel a sadness at the pit of your stomach when they are disposed of. The film has the typical zombies biting humans and blood splatter. It even has the same munching on guts. It just doesn't do anything for the zombie genre to give it memory. And  the story's climax is rather anti-climactic and ridiculous. One wonders how two people can submerged in an army of zombies and not get bit(for they are the main stars who seem to always manage escapability)while others seem to get bit rather easily. The film sole motivation is to show people getting bit..nothing else. Just go watch a Romero film for lasting effect.\n",

      "George Burns returns as the joshing Almighty after enjoying a big success with 1977's Oh  God!  an upbeat fantasy made successful by a sudden need in the 1970s to switch from devil-driven thrillers to comedic redemption (although it made money  the original was more in line with the Topper comedies of the '30s than a return to feel-good religious cinema). Here  God appears to a young girl (Louanne  who had earlier starred in a stage production of Annie) and asks her to spread his Divine Word  causing her nothing but trouble from grown-ups in the process. Peculiar  family-oriented film appears to be warm-hearted enough  and Burns gets to chime in with a nice barrage of wry jibes  but the writing is half-slapstick and half-seriousness  with the adults of the piece considering putting little Louanne away  all of which makes God seem more like a troublemaker than an elderly friend. Louanne is another problem: a perky kid with wizened little eyes  she is untrained for screen-acting and occasionally seems awkward. The medium-budget production has a gloppy  TV-movie appearance  with few graceful touches. The final scene mimics the climax of the first Oh  God! in that it brings a wistful sentiment to the mix  which is welcomed. It's the most subtle moment in the movie. ** from ****\n",

      "This movie probably began with a good idea but that's as far as it went. When I read the cover at Blockbuster I thought it had promise but that was based on the overall idea for the movie. The movie began with a professor talking about how in the future we will be able to see creatures from other dimensions. There was no explanation of how that would happen but that's okay I thought it would be developed that in the movie. It wasn't. In the next scene we see two young men lying on tables with tubes taped to their heads. Beside each one are two attractive women. The men begin asking Do you hear that or Do you see them. We conclude they think they are seeing ghosts or some other creature that seem invisible or they are hallucinating. The women do not see these creatures. This was fine for the first five minutes BUT THIS SCENE GOES ON FOR A FULL HOUR. It is briefly punctuated by flashbacks that have no correlation to the so called plot of the film. We are also introduced to a man in a lab coat and what appear to be Middle Eastern terrorists. What is this about? We never find out. The flash backs lead us to believe that the terrorists are forcing the man in the lab coat to perform diabolical experiments on these young people but we never understand why. At the end of the movie the terrorists finally do what terrorists do  they blow up the lab  but why? What is the point? We have no idea. This film contains so many disconnected thoughts and ideas that there are too many to enumerate but one more notable one is that fact that the man in the lab coats and the terrorist pop in and out of the room throughout the movie and not once do the young men attempt to escape or even leave the tables on which they are laying even though they are not strapped down! The makers of the movie also bring in cameo appearances by cockroaches on several occasions but again we never learn what that has to do with the storyline. Sorry but this movie was a waste of $4 and the time I spent driving to the rental store and then watching it. Take my advice. Don't rent it.\n",

      "Quentin Tarantino's partner in crime Roger Avary (co-writer on Pulp Fiction) ventures out on his own (Q.T. goes exec. prod. this time) for this over-boiled French thriller.  Eric Stoltz is Zed  safe cracker extraordinaire who has drifted over to France from the U.S. at the request of an old friend. There he teams up with a motley crew of drugged out hippies who  with little or no planning  think they can knock off a bank vault full of gold bullion on a French national holiday.  Avary has reworked the robbery gone wrong theme that Tarantino developed so well in Reservoir Dogs  only Killing Zoe is not good enough to survive on the strength of this alone  so Avary has thrown in a rather beautiful distraction. Julie Delpy is Zoe  a student come call girl who entertains Zed on his arrival in Paris. A stunning distraction she certainly is  but nothing more.  I guess our director wanted to add a different angle to this basic theme  but sadly the move did not help to add the depth his shallow plot so desperately needed. There was never a story in this idea  which was nothing more than that  an idea. Even the surreal journey into the seedy dives of Paris is uninspiring. I figure one would have to concede that there was never much of a movie in the story of a bunch of gangsters shooting each other up over a botched jewellery heist either  that is until you add intricate characters and snappy dialogue. Reservoir Dogs had it  Killing Zoe did not.  Stoltz's strong interpretation of the doubtful Zed and Jean Hughes-Anglade's mad portrayal of the obsessive ring leader do nothing to lift proceedings. In short  Avary has unsuccessfully attempted to conjure entertainment out of nothing.  Friday  September 15  1995 - Astor Theatre\n",

So I saw the cover of Bled over at Hollywood Video and was kind of curious what it was about  it looked kind of interesting  so I decided to rent it. Why? Why do I always fall for it? Not only did this movie not fulfill the satisfaction I needed for my gore and senseless violence and nudity  but I was bored out of mind.

I think  I dunno. So her friends get excited and decide they wanna try the drug too  I think  I dunno. So after they decide to try the drug  things get weird  the fantasies are real  I think  I dunno  and the vampire is now enjoying the will big breasted girls in scandly clad clothing.

Though I felt that the directing was done well  the craziness in their dialogue is just a little too much cheese. I think I got about an hour into this before I even started to realize what it was the point was that they were trying to drive home. You catch on pretty quick that this whole family is pretty quirky and something is off about them  it's just a little too slow. This movie could easily have been about 45 minutes and been a lot better. The only thing that made it bearable was the two bottles of wine that I downed during the course of the flick. Bring on the slasher films folks  because at least I know what to expect out of them. This was not my thing  too much dark humour  and the subject material of cannibalism was a bit explicit and gross. I have to say that Randy Quaid played the part as well as it could have been  and I will give him props for that as I normally see him as a drunken goofball or a washed out fighter pilot who likes to kill aliens.

      "Roomies is the story of a guy who loses everything except his incredible girlfriend and an idea for a corn dog that he plans to patent and sell. Immediately his uncle dies and leaves him a house and a car  and he gets some roommates in to help pay the rent and gets a job. Then his girlfriend gets drunk and cheats on him  so he goes and writes a book about roommates and becomes famous.  88 minutes. None of these details of the plot are explored in any detail  what you read above is more or less as interesting as the film will be. When his uncle dies there are some breasts on screen  one of the potential roommates he interviews is pretty funny for about 40 seconds. The ending is literally the worst i've ever seen. I want the other 87 minutes of my life back!  I hadn't thought anyone could make a movie with so little merit: Surely there are rules against this sort of thing getting to the public? The script can't be longer than twenty pages  and the budget must have been minuscule because the whole film has about 3 locations and a car. The only conceivable use for Roomies  in my opinion  is if you're holding someone hostage and want to frustrate them beyond human thought. If so  get it on repeat and you'll have a ready made gibbering wreck within the day.  one-and-a-half out of 10\n",

This is worth seeing for those in the right frame of mind  meaning that this is not so much a good horror film as a film to lampoon for its funny quotes and bad effects. This film is best watched with other like minded individuals so you have someone to laugh with.  You'll laugh as Greg leaps and shuffles around the lab  petting his pet rabbit  while his hunchback shifts from right to left on his back. Greg  stop clowning!  scolds Dr. Brandon. You'll laugh as J.G. Patterson gives hand signals to direct Greg to the other side of the operating table  while his hand is in the shot.

      "...a film comes along that manages to be absolutely terrible from the opening titles on through to the studio logo tagged at the end of the closing credits. This was such a film - the very type you can not stop watching for fear of missing a moment of its ever-descending quality.  Forget the low budget that's indicated by a slow  monotonous opening sequence that shows secret service agents running alongside a presidential motorcade with no crowds  no traffic or location discernible. Forget the jumbled logic needed to even remotely make the actual plot seem plausible. Forget that Roy Scheider delivers some of the hammiest dialogue whilst completely failing to hide his shame.  This clunker is terribly paced  bombarded by a score that's simply laughable  and seems edited by a third grader. All the while twisting scenarios to cover up the hardest thing about filming a presidential storyline on the cheap: making him seem presidential.  I honestly feel asleep briefly in the last reel  and when I awoke  I ran it back so as not to miss a single excruciating frame. Try this drinking game: take a shot every time you see it blatantly aping another much better film. You'll doze off  too.  Not since 'The Man' w/ Samuel L. Jackson and Eugene Levy have I seen such a delightfully unredeemable project. I may give out copies as Christmas gifts. Zero stars. A thousand laughs.\n",

This would-be comedy about a girl - Kathy Ireland in her film debut - who's a total schlump whose inner babe is only awakened after she falls to the centre of the Earth and has a set of badly filmed  impossible-to-follow adventures (chiefly involving a set of dwarves who want her because she has big bones - go figure!) before returning home changed for the better isn't funny  gripping or entertaining in the slightest.

      "I never really understood the controversy and hype this movie caused. Especially in French and the neighboring countries (in Belgium  where I am located  for example)  Baise-Moi was announced as THE most shocking and THE most thought-provoking social drama you could ever experience. Yeah right! It might be a little shocking  maybe (how often do you see someone getting shot up the arse?)  but the weak and pointless plot surely didn't cause me to think much. Baise-Moi is another one of those blame everything that goes wrong on society-films and they're generally not very convincing. About 99% of the people functions perfectly well in this society so why would you blame this exact same society for the vile and hopeless acts of two deranged nymph-girls? The two main characters and their miserable lives are introduced separately and in flashes. Nadine just killed her roommate; Manu shot her brother and the two meet in an abandoned train-station  late at night. They decide to travel around France together  leaving a trail of sex and blood behind wherever they made a stop. Although we're constantly exposed to pornography and violence  this film is very boring to sit through. Like the girls are indicating themselves all the time  the dialogues are lame and the people they run into (and kill",

Even the dance number is bad. I like most of the cast in this movie  so that makes me feel bad about writing a negative review of it but I feel obligated. The Rock  Andre 3000  and Vince Vaughn were in a comedy. No one else seemed to decide what movie genre they were acting in. I feel bad for Travolta because he brought the same Chili Palmer from Get Shorty to this movie. He was totally consistent in the role  but this movie is so different from the original that the character sticks out like a sore thumb. I was going to give this movie 4/10 because I like the actors so much but there is a conversation in the movie about a certain song that is so asinine I couldn't believe the performers actually said it.

      "The book is great. It's one of my favorite books ever. The film  on the other hand  is amazingly insipid and bad! When I heard Damon would play Ripley  I knew this production was doomed. But I didn't expect it to be this bad. The actors go around and act very showy. Except for Law (and even he is guilty of some showy acting)  all the actors here are near amateurish. Speaking Italian and moving one's arms or hair about shouldn't be considered as acting. Damon is miscast. He's way too stiff for a character that's supposed to be a chameleon. Paltrow is forgettable and Hoffman plays yet another effeminate slimy character. Talk about typecasting.  What's really unforgivable about the script (written by the overrated director) is that it completely forgoes every subtle details from the book and comes up with many of its own  and none of them work! The addition of the Jazz music stuff is totally WRONG! I guess Minghella's idea of Italy in the late 50s  early 60s is clouded with images of Chet Baker roaming the Italian countryside and spreading amore. Yep  Minghella is a true visionary. The film is so bleeding obvious. That silly scene when Ripley drives through the narrow street full of mirrors. Very laughable. Yes  we get the point!!! Every point or detail comes across a mile away  so much so that the film might give the audience the false impression that they have psychic powers. We know  for example  that the Blanchett character  introduced at the beginning of the movie  will return later on only complicate things. And the soundtrack  at times  is totally inappropriate. Whimsical when it shouldn't be. The film goes on for too long and in all sorts of pointless directions. There are too many boring characters populating the landscape (many that weren't in the book). This film is bad! Really bad!  Apparently  Minghella's son told his father that the Ripley novel was his favorite. Mr. Minghella then proceeded to direct it as a favor of sorts to his son. Well  the director did achieve what he set out to do: Talented Mr. Ripley  with its Hitchcock aspirations  is a film strictly made for 12 year olds!\n",

      "This frothy romantic comedy is based on the kind of story I loved as a teenager  but now find rather distasteful. In the case of May-September attachments  doubtless what is on the mind of the elder party is either lust  or an inability to face the reality of aging  or both. And the younger is most likely looking for the kind parent that she (or he) lacked as a child. These underlying agendas seem more pathetic than romantic to me now; there is also something rather predatory about them.  Dick Powell looked a bit embarrassed--as well he should--at playing the elder lover in this silly story. He was  at fifty  attempting the role of a thirty-eight-year-old man romancing a teen-ager. But young Debbie Reynolds was a knockout--pretty and saucy and full of vinegar--as a misbehaving seventeen-year-old presented as a kind of gift to the morally upright and honest screenwriter  as a subject for him to study. Her spirited performance wrung from me a better rating than this film would otherwise deserve. Anne Francis was cast as Powell's beautiful  but brittle fiancée  and handled her small role deftly.  Some of the dialogue was quite amusing  too  so it's not a total washout.  5/10\n",

The film portrays a woman as the great white savior of some small Midwestern town  and everyone else in the town (mostly men) are just mere damsels in distress  incapable of honor  who can't fend for themselves and have to rely on the main character for redemption. This film is just some love affair that the producer has with some undisciplined  arrogant  pushy little squirt  who he expects the audience to admire.  The person who made this movie probably spent his whole life in a seeker-sensitive church  and had the freedom to dump garbage on small church members as wacky lunatics and not the majority. The same people who give money to the Salvation Army at Christmastime  collecting donations to help missionaries  the poor and the homeless  singing  fellow-shipping  and making friends with each other.

Charlotte's kid was annoying to watch as she was in too many scenes--the title could easily have been SATC: Parents' Night Out. Camera angles just weren't that good  especially regarding Carrie's face.   There was a token black woman thrown in whose character doesn't have a proper exit and too few appearances by the gay men friends who seemed thrown in with no purpose anyway. Samantha's going back and forth from LA choked the story flow  especially when she comes in for Fashion Week and nothing happens.

      "First off  I'm in the U.S.  When I first saw this  I thought it was an obvious - and loathsome - rip off of The Office (UK). I would have thus awarded it zero stars  but lo and behold  it came out long before the Ricky Gervais series.  Still  it's hard to watch this or any other show with a similar dynamic (including the American Office) without comparison. It just isn't even close to being the same thing.  I will give it some credit for being original  and ahead of its time. I'll also say that it - and the U.S. Office and Larry Sanders - are actual satires. The UK Office is something grander and more transcendent  as if populated with real people in events that felt like they actually happened. However  unlike this or the shrill Christopher Guest mockumentaries  it isn't really a satire  while The Newsroom definitely is.  Be that as it may  The Newsroom still isn't very funny. It's aloof  and self-aware  but with a cast and crew not nearly smart or talented enough to heft the goods. It's weighty comedy being carried on weak shoulders. Commendable  but ultimately not recommended.  --- And what's with the lack of an anamorphic DVD?!

In hindsight  the only thing that I can think of is that the genre generally appeals to me. But this movie was a total waste of effort. It fails on every level  and to see that it's described on IMDb as a comedy really leaves me at a loss. I don't recall more than a couple of chuckles. There are more laughs in any episode of Law and Order than in The Last Man. Seriously.  Too much of the characters' interaction just didn't seem to me to have any foundation  and was therefore very unlikely/unbelievable.

Both lead characters have the maturity of seven-year-olds and are much less interesting to spend time with. A veteran supporting cast including Fred Clark  Harry Morgan  and Eva Gabor lend excellent support. And  the beautiful cinematography certainly makes the rich countryside of Spain seem lush.

      "In 1932  Humphrey Bogart was a relative unknown--an unproven actor who was starring in one of his first films. And  because he was an unknown  the movie they gave him was clearly a B-movie--a quick film with relatively low expectations. After seeing it  I could see why it would still take Bogart many more years AND another film studio before he became a household name. While the film isn't terrible  it certainly isn't good--making it more of a curiosity than anything else when seen today.  Bogart is a pilot who has dreams of building his own aircraft engine company. However  when a vacuous rich playgirl comes his way  his dreams all seem to go on hold. As one of the characters in the film said  the combination of the two is like oil and water--they just don't mix.  While Bogart is throwing away his promising career  his sister is going full speed on the Road to Skankville--having met a sleazy guy who convinces her to sleep with rich guys so they can shake them down for tons of cash! Bogey has no idea his sister ISN'T the actress she claims to be and doesn't realize later that the rich woman he loves leaves him for the same guy whose mistress is....Bogart's SISTER!!! All this leads up to a finale that is reasonably enjoyable. However  what follows is one of the dumbest scenes I have watched in a very long time! By now  the rich lady is not going to marry the guy sleeping with Bogey's sister (whew!) but because she's now poor and no good for Bogart  she's about to fly away and kill herself. Bogey finds out  chases the plane on foot  jumps on the plane as it's taking off and crawls up the fuselage to take control of the plane and save her!!! This is so utterly silly and ridiculous  I found myself laughing out loud. Up until then  I might have scored it a 4 or 5--this sunk the movie to a 3 (how one reviewer gave this an 8 is beyond me).  The bottom line is that this was a talking and silly film. On top of that  it's all wrong for Bogart  as the action hero at the end and the simpering lover are horrible matches for his persona that was so wonderfully created in the early 40s. Manly and solid better suits the man--one of America's great actors but clearly out of his element here.  By the way  those who love Pre-Code films and their very adult sensibilities may want to see this one. Practically everyone in the film believes in and practices pre-marital sex and Bogey curses in the film--things you never would have seen after the toughened and more moralistic Production Code was adopted in 1934.\n",

One of my biggest problems with it is that it's a complete ripoff of Robin Hood  and let be honest and say that I love Robin Hood with Errol Flynn  and Robin Hood: Men in Tights.

The plots:  Story one:The classic.  A young couple feel the it is time that they should try to in prove their financial life by picking up a $1500 car.But when the guy goes to pick a car a car starts to talk to him.The car (called Banns) says that to get everything that he has ever wanted in life that he must buy Baans for $5000.So while the guys relationship crumbles Baans does everything he can to show who really is in charge.  Story two:Kitchen culture.  A guy that might get thrown out by his land lord due to how messy his flat is discovers that due to keeping a tuna pasta in his fridge for six months the it has now moulded and evolved into a green mouldy version of himself!.And while they start off as friends they end up having a big falling out the leads to a final battle to see if the real guy or his fridge clone will survive.  Story three:Too good to be true.  A girl signs up with a dating agency and she gets matched with a guy the is perfect for her.But she is unsure that the guy is too perfect and when she thinks that she sees him 'shut down' she starts to get spooked. View on the film:  The first thing that i have to mention is the rating for the film in england where it has been given an eighteen rating even thought it has no nudity swearing or blood at all.And the other odd thing about all the stories is that they all have happy endings where the goodies win!.And while the first story is too close to the Stephen King classic Christine the second story is easily the highlight of the film with director Tom Parkinson making the nuttiness of the story feel like a low-budget Muppets episode!.  Final view on the film  While it does have a bit of a 'remake; feel their is enough wackiness to make this a good horror 'comedy'.\n",

      "This should be re-named Everybody Loves Sebastian. The 1983 rural go-nowhere town high school junior (or senior? - they seemed to flip flop on that one) with weird hair and Leo-like good looks has a big plate full of issues. His step-dad announces definite plans to have a sex-change operation  upon which his mom calls the marriage quits; Sebastian is called the f word by everyone and their mother  all-the-while kissing around with various girls  getting high on Ready-Whip at a supermarket  and saving a strawberry prostitute from the clutches of her ruthless pimp.  Sebastian's buddies make Eddie Haskal look like a choir boy; bad association doesn't get much worse. Sebastian seems to go for Harold's suicide attempts record (although he won't admit suicidal tendanccies). For no apparent reason the genius level SAT scoring Sebastian MUST graduate a year early  although he has no clue about the future  nor does he want to attend college (what gives with this nonsense?).  This film is a look into a few weeks in the life of someone who is PRETTY MESSED UP. The final scene suggests that things will be alright  although the HOW is left entirely up to the viewer.  The makers of this film seem to bank solely on the undisputed appeal of the very attractive male lead. The story leaves a lot to be desired. Looking for what will this gorgeous kid do next...? doesn't exactly satisfy. The lackluster production values just don't measure up to other films  independent or otherwise. A low budget and weak story need more than a pretty face to carry it through. The results of this project are forgettable and an insult to intelligent cinema fans.\n",

Maybe it was even 16mm blown up to 35mm  dunno. Dull is the script  which is tedious and 'Jules Pfeiffer'-ish. That is  kind of 1960s bossa-nova cocktail party cool. Like our beatnik grandparents might have spoken if they were trying to appear really straight. The 'slice-of-life' characters were mostly annoying.

      "It begins with a couple of disgusting sex-comedy gags  but soon it reveals its true colors: it wants to be a Death Wish clone. I say wants to because the script gets so increasingly laughable by the minute that it ends up looking like an absurdist Death Wish spoof!

The other major problem is that you can't tell most of the characters apart; of course  you know who Borgnine and Roundtree and even James Van Patten are  but all the other roles could have been played by different actors in various scenes  and you wouldn't know the difference.

      "It is said that there are some people out there who actually ADMIRE Monogram's movies. Well -- and why not? Monogram Studios lived on a kind of Cost Plus basis; cost  plus enough to pay the rent and buy a pizza and a bottle of robust muscatel every once in a while. Sure  they're cheap. But let's face it: they're coarse  fast  Philistine  vulgar  but exhilarating. They have no pretensions at all. They're designed to divert the audience for an hour or so at the bottom of a double bill. So what if John Wayne gallops through the Wild West along a road lined with telephone poles? This isn't art  it's entertainment.  Take this movie  Flight to Mars. At the beginning  when we're first meeting the characters  a man might introduce his female companion abruptly  avoiding any tedious subtlety: Professor  this is my fiancée and assistant  who is a rocket scientist and a beautiful woman. She loves me but is growing impatient with me because I'm always wrapped up in my scientific work. Perhaps you could steal her from me  marry her  give her the babies and the picket-fenced home she yearns for. If necessary I will die on this journey to see her dreams realized. Also  she likes it a little rough. It saves a lot of writing and shooting time  doesn't it? That's what people mean when they say a narrative is fast. (This one was shot in five days.) Why should we have to hint about these things? I mean  what the hell is this  a cheap sci fi movie or Henry James? Actually this is a particularly well-funded example of a Monogram movie. It's in color  for one thing. Cinecolor to be exact. (You can tell it's not any other color you'd recognize.) And look at the cast. The female lead is dismissible  as is usual with Monogram  but the male leads are definitely up there on the B List. Cameron Mitchell as the reporter  yet to hit his stride as a male lead  which  come to think of it  he never really did. And Arthur Franz as the pipe-smoking head scientist  the pride of Perth Amboy  New Jersey. And -- for science fiction fans -- how about THIS pair of aces: both Morris Ankrum AND John Litel! There's not really much point in describing the plot in detail. The five crew members crash land on Mars where they find an underground civilization inhabited by organisms whose evolution was isomorphic with ours  right down to their having five digits and willowy babes in short skirts. And they picked up English from listening to our broadcasts. American broadcasts  that is  judging from their speech. They're led by a sinister cabal who try to hijack the space ship  build many imitations of it  and colonize earth. They do not succeed.  The special effects aren't very special. The men walk around a couple of spare sets  wearing black costumes with stylized lightning bolts emblazoned on their chests and scarlet capes billowing behind them. Their names consist exclusively of English phonemes -- Alzar  Terris  Ikron. The lissome Martian who falls for Arthur Franz is named Alita  with an Indo-European diminutive appendage  and she already knows what kissing is.  Overall  I found it as snappy as it was intended to be  but dull too. The story is that of any Buck Rogers 1930s serial. Once the earthlings and the Martians meet and it's established that they have a common language  and that the Martians have a sinister agenda  that's it. In two hours  even an indifferent screenwriter could turn this into a story of Nazi spies in World War II. The plot is done by the numbers  the dialog has no sparkle  the acting is pedestrian.  However  dedicated aficionados of Monogram productions should enjoy it. After all  Jean-Luc Goddard  the contrarian French egghead  dedicated A Bout de Soufflé to Monogram  so they can't have been all that bad.\n",

To further defray costs  they get two other strangers to come along. What makes it interesting are the relationships both before and during this vacation--in particular  showing how this beautiful setting actually changes their outlooks on life. Unfortunately  this good idea is totally spoiled by two key performances in the ensemble cast that are so bad that they ruin the film. Ann Harding plays the most important role in the film in a manner that makes her seem ridiculous. Her doe-eyed expression and vacant stares really make you wonder if this isn't a zombie movie or she's just meant to be an idiot!

      "Against my own better judgment I went to see this film today  and God I wish I hadn't. Awful. The first AvP film looks like a classic compared to this  it's THAT bad. These guys actually make Paul WS Anderson look like a master storyteller. In fact  this is what I'd expect an Alien and/or Predator film to look like if it was made by Uwe Boll! This movie actually offended me  and Lord only knows what would transpire if Ridley Scott or HR Giger were ever forced to watch this piece of crap. I can't understand how any fan of either franchise could like this film.  Truly I don't know where to begin. I mean  the first AvP was poop  but it at least a semi-interesting story and setting  and occasionally some genuine tension. It didn't take itself overly seriously and it could at least be semi enjoyed on a purely leave your brain at home basis. But this one  it felt to me as though the people behind it thought they were making the next horror masterpiece. One after the other was a contrived 'suspenseful' scene in a dark room or corridor with creepy music playing  essentially bashing you over the head saying be scared NOW. As James Cameron once said  you can't be told to be scared  you can only have your own senses heightened. The guys that made this film obviously weren't paying attention because they tried everything in the book to force you to be scared rather than letting you come to that level yourself. It's a cliché for internet nerds to say God  I was so bored from this movie and felt like leaving  well this is exactly how I felt  even in the middle of the action scenes. They took this film totally seriously  which removed any possibility of enjoyment. Even the gag about how governments don't lie to their people was played without a hint of irony.  As for the characters  I knew going in that the human characters were going to be completely pointless to this film but seriously if they're going to be on-screen at least have them doing SOMETHING that is relevant to the story. I don't care about this guy being beaten up by his dreamgirl's boyfriend  I don't care about the mother who's own daughter doesn't even know her  boo-hoo! (a pair of night-vision goggles for a present? Give me a break!) or the released criminal just trying to make a decent living and set an example for his brother  what a guy. Hell  even the obligatory hot-chick-in-panties moment was more contrived than usual. I get the feeling they expected the audience to be so shocked at the ending  as well as seeing chestbursters come out of kids  expectant mothers being raped and the like  that that would make up for everything. I don't think so.  Then we move onto the stars of the film  and again very little to write home about. Were the aliens well-designed? I wouldn't have a clue because you can never see the damn things. All you see is one of a mouth  a head  a tail or a really dodgy cg outline climbing a wall  and barely enough to actually process that it is in fact an alien before Mr I cut Marilyn Manson and NIN music videos  think I'll do the same thing here Editor goes at it with the slice tool. Also  notice how hack action directors always set their films at night and in the rain? Hmmmm. The Predator could've been fighting giant sea monkeys for all we knew! Yes  the Predator was more impressive this time around  and I did think some of the new weaponry was cool  but that was about it. Also  since when does a Predator sound like a dinosaur from The Lost World? There were a couple of things that I kinda liked though. One was the use of sound effects and music from the original films (I also giggled a little bit at Get to the chopper!)  although other references were stupid (The main character's name being Dallas  give me a break). I also liked the visual FX for the Predator's vision  as well as how the hybrid alien looked (certainly beat the one from Resurrection). But really  those are the only positive things.  Overall I found this movie inane  pointless  insulting and above all else offensive to the vision of the original creators of both creatures. That they've left the door open for another one leaves me almost depressed.  If they had any decency they'd remove Dan O'Bannon  Ron Schusett and HR Giger from the credits of this film. They've done nothing to deserve this.\n",

In his latest job  he cleans a new crime scene and destroys evidence and isn't aware the crime hasn't been officially reported. Uh oh  this can't be good.   You hear about Cleaners all the time  but usually when a mob or gangland hit is involved when bodies etc need to be removed and the area cleaned up. This one is different in that Tom Cutler works with the Police to clean up after the police have done their investigation of a crime scene. Hey  someone has to do it. You know the Police won't. The movie makes that quite clear and it is up to the family to get the area cleaned up.   This is almost a good thriller  but a side plot involving Tom's daughter (Palmer) makes this story somewhat awkward. I guess they had to fill in some time. Oh  they brought this side plot around to connect with the another side plot  but it was still a reach and awkward. See?

      "I watched this film with a sort of dangerous fascination  like a hedgehog trapped in the headlights. There is no doubt that (even if you enjoyed it) it's a bad movie  but the important question is why? It has a good cast; it's lively; it's prepared to tackle sex head on  with some of the characters actually getting some of it here and there  which is unusual for a British comedy. It also has Johnny Vegas and Mackenzie Crook  Marmite performers agreed but they've have had their moments in the past.  What it's principally lacking is charm. The characters are impossibly idiotic  unbelievable and alienating  so that instead of a film of Men Behaving Badly the producers have made Game On. Any mediocre writer wanting to make a film about the sexual attitudes of dozy  sexist British men would have got hold of a few copies of Loaded  Zoo or even Viz to read Sid the Sexist and the thing would have written itself. Instead  the producers clearly tried to make up some moronic  difficult to care about  characters. Character comedy - as opposed to slapstick etc - only works if the audience can recognise some human truth to the situation. But watching this film is like being told an annoying joke that you know is not going to end up funny but you can't stop it.  Sadly  the film is also poorly made. The plot structure is weak  there's little character delineation or development  and many of the scenes aren't funny. Time after time the same lame reggae chips in to divide scenes  pointlessly and gratingly. There's a lot of needless repetition - when you've done one joke about parking outside a sex party you don't need to do it again. One wonders what the UK Film Council saw in the script.  This is a world where most men are rakes  and most women are continually up for it. The Apartment and Alfie satirised much the same world view  but the producers of this film accept it without criticism. Thus they've ended up with a kind of inferior update of Confessions of a Window Cleaner. Somebody British needs to have another go at this kind of thing  and do it properly  a good next project for Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright I think...\n",

Armed with rotten plot  terrible editing  stilted acting  and headache-inducing 'style' (sorry  I have no other words for it)  Sanctimony is the kind of movie that almost forces you to re-evaluate an entire genre; that is  this film is so bad that even the thrillers I condemned as complete failures now seem a little better.  Now  not only Sanctimony is a terrible film in itself  it also succeeds in the difficult task of ripping off better movies and do a pathetic job with it. Right from the main titles -- nothing but a blatant attempt to reproduce the ones from Se7en -- I was under the impression that something didn't smell quite right. As soon as the movie started with a series of corny  wanna-be hip quick-cuts full of gory images and bombastic colors  I knew where that smell was coming from.  It turns out that two policemen  or rather policeman Jim Renart (Michael Paré) and policewoman Dorothy Smith (Jennifer Rubin)  are investigating on a murder spree in Vancouver. A serial killer  known as Monkey Killer (what a menacing  chilling nickname  uh?) for his working methods  has killed quite a lot of people. You see  this nut apparently works following the proverb see no evil  hear no evil  speak no evil and cuts eyes  ears  and tongues out of his victims. So far  six eyes  six ears  and three tongues. In very ingenious fashion  Renart and Smith figure out that the Monkey Killer is probably going to kill other three people... well  because he probably wants to complete the number 666. So suddenly the film focuses on Tom Gerrick (Casper Van Dien)  a young  successful  good-looking businessman  with a dreadful temper. And that's where the rip-off of American Psycho kicks in.  So we follow the life of the two police officers and the young psychopath  none of which is interesting in the least  until they finally meet. Along the way to that  a disco where Renart barely misses Gerrick unintentionally offers us one of the funniest scenes in recent memory: Renart goes in the back of the disco club  because... well  just because the script tells us it's a suspect place; then  with one single punch in the stomach  Renard gets rid of a big guard who blocks the path  and the guard is never heard of again? Does this scene strike anyone else as completely unrealistic?  Anyway  after another murder  Gerrick turns in as a witness  but Smith and especially Renart immediately suspect he might be the killer. In typical Basic Instinct fashion  Smith gets some dates with the young businessman  under the assumption that she might discover his true identity.  I won't spoil the ending but it is  quite simply  an embarrassment; there are contradictions  some plot holes  issues that never get resolved  and especially there is one last scene where a brutal mass murder  supposed to be shocking and sad  comes off as such laughably overdone and nonsensical that I frankly can't imagine how anyone could not laugh at it.  At 87 minutes  Sanctimony is really pushing it. You never care about one single character  because they are all so flat (not to mention boring) that you know exactly who is who the first time you meet them. You are never pulled into the story  because the scenes are connected through weak plot devices when not downright unnecessary and out of place. The acting ranges from average (Van Dien) to downright atrocious (Rubin  and most of the supporting cast); the music is abysmal generic techno  and the photography is one of the worst I have ever seen. Of course  like every fiasco of the genre  we are provided with a little bit of gratuitous nudity.  3/10\n",

      "I remember watching this mini-series the first time in 1984 with a growing sense of anger and indignation. Having read the comments on this title  I must agree with those from the people in Greece. This was produced to coincide with the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games and  to me  it seemed like nothing more than an exercise in jingoistic  flag-waving American nationalism in which the American athletes are glorified at everyone else's expense. Some other nationalities would have every right to feel deeply insulted at the way they were portrayed in this series. It may  however  help to explain the way in which many American spectators behaved at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and the TV coverage which seemed only interested in events that Americans were likely to win.\n",

      "This is a movie that should have been a mini-series as it tries to get too much information in too small a space. The whole story is constantly being bombarded with sub-plots  character introduction and meaningless pieces information that go nowhere. There is a underlying plot where boy meets a girl  she has doubts but gets married anyhow and then her doubts surface and she goes to see if they are real. They turn out not to be but her husband won't believe that she was not unfaithful and her almost boyfriend doesn't want her as she was not unfaithful to her husband. With that said there are no less than 1000 sub-plots and character introductions that make this plot almost incomprehensible. In the first 15 minutes you are inundated with so many things and situations that you just stop caring. You don't care about any of the confused and screwed up cast that drifts in and out of the story like vultures feeding on a corpse. Each one comes in and takes some interest away from the viewer. After a half-hour  and completely disinterested  I stayed and watched the remaining two and a half hours out of pure morbid curiosity. I couldn't imagine where it was going but like staring at a fire I just couldn't get up and turn it off. The production values are superb but the resulting movie is a waste of time; wash your socks instead.\n",

      "I suppose I can see why critics give this film two out five stars  it isn't fantastic  but I think it is worth a look  from director Shawn Levy (Cheaper by the Dozen  Night at the Museum). Basically 14-year-old Jason Shepherd (Malcolm in the Middle's Frankie Muniz) is often lying to his parents and teachers  and his teacher warns him that if he doesn't do his creative writing  he will fail his whole semester and have to repeat the grade during summer. So he completes his work  but getting a lift from Hollywood producer Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti)  who hit him on the way to school  he manages to leave his paper with the story Big Fat Liar in the car. He finds out from a movie trailer that Marty stole his paper and is turning it into a major movie  so he and his best friend Kaylee (She's the Man's Amanda Bynes) are on a mission to prove Jason is for once telling the truth. Marty of course is too nasty and smug to give Jason's father Harry (Michael Bryan French) a phone call  and he evens burns the Big Fat Liar paper. So now Jason and Kaylee are determined to make Marty's life as hellish as possible  until he agrees to call Jason's Dad. They put blue dye in his swimming pool  and orange hair dye in his shampoo  and much more naughty pranks creating chaos for Marty's career. There is the obvious point when Jason looks like he wants to give up  but don't worry  all characters that despise Marty help out in the final operation  and with Jason's parents coming  he wants to finally prove his truthfulness  and boy does he deliver  big style. Also starring Amanda Detmer as Monty Kirkham  Lee Majors as Vince  Donald Adeosun Faison as Frank Jackson  Sandra Oh as Mrs. Phyllis Caldwell  Russell Hornsby as Marcus Duncan  Christine Tucci as Carol Shepherd and American Pie's John Cho as Dustin 'Dusty' Wong. Muniz is likable  Byrnes proves a very surprisingly talented support  and even though he is wasting his time and talent a little  Giamatti is great at being nasty. It is a kids film  so if it seems corny  cheesy or predictable  just keep that in mind  and try to enjoy the performances and slapstick. Okay!\n",

      "I checked this out at the Vancouver International Film Festival and was not impressed.  The only area of the film I enjoyed was the commentary on film-making. For the most part  this film seemed random and somewhat fantastical (I don't say that in a complimentary way  however) and just silly. It was as if he was mixing fantasy with everyday life  which may sounds intriguing in some films  but the fantasy merely seemed needlessly perverse.  My criticism of this film is not upon the actors  rather the story itself. I found it boring and narcissistic. I wanted my money back  but considering it was a Film Festival  that wasn't about to happen.\n",

      "This show can most accurately be described as TV Bubble-Gum: It's chewing  it has a good taste to it  and it lasts a long time. But  like Bubble-Gum  it can leave a bad taste in your mouth after a few too many chews.  This show features very simple questions that take the form of simply games  like Hangman  guessing a simple phrase or guessing items on a short list. Callers are the contestants  and anybody can play.  The questions  though  are terribly easy. There's some techno music pumped into the background that's fashioned into a continuous loop. It never seems to get old  but it never adds much to the show anyway. The hostess  however  regardless of which one that it  is extremely personable  pleasant enough to watch and can make some very amusing facial expressions. I rather enjoy that British woman.  But there's nothing to this show. It's simplistic and uncompelling  although it can be entertaining if absolutely nothing else is on.\n",

      "Let me start off by saying that I loved the original Grudge. It was bar none one of the scariest  most hair-rising experiences I've ever had in a filled movie theatre. I'm not kidding. Being a self-declared japanophile also made the flick look better in my eyes (if the setting had been changed to some American suburb I probably would've ended up hating the film).  That said... this movie is a complete mess! I won't say it sucks  because A) the movie does have some good points  B) it sucks is the lamest put-down in the history of lame put-downs. So what does the movie have going for it? Well  for starters it has a pretty cool look: through filters and the use of bleak  washed-out colours  Takashi Shimizu almost recreates the downbeat  angst-ridden atmosphere of the original. A few scenes are genuinely shocking and unpredictable. Unfortunately  the rest of the film is just plain bad. Period.  The story is all over the place  needlessly told Tarantino style  i.e. the scenes are out of chronological order. This technique is pointless in the case of this movie and it merely makes things more confusing. Frankly  a straightforward plot would've worked better. The original was also lacking plot-wise  but it did make sense and the film more than made up for its thin plot with lots of scares and a genuinely tense atmosphere. Grudge 2 has none of these elements and is just a waste of time.  Let's not forget the TV-show acting skills which make the cast of the original Grudge look like Emily Watson and Katherine Hepburn. Simply put  the movie doesn't work. It's too slow  too dull  and just not scary enough to make up for the confusing plot (which adds nothing new to the story  by the way  so not even Grudge fans will be pleased).  Oh  and what is it with the old man playing Japanese peek-a-boo on the bus?? Is this supposed to be comic relief? Artistic statement? Or what?\n",

      "The MTV sci-fi animated series Æon Flux is brought to life with Charlize Theron playing the title character  a freedom fighter who fights oppression in the walled city of Bregna  400 hundred years into the future. For her latest mission  she has been sent to kill the city's leader Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas)  but she uncovers secrets along the way.  Aeon Flux falls under the category of good premise  mediocre execution. Interesting story yet the film was a little dull. A lot of people are saying that this is one of the worst movies of the year and that's not true at all. It may be a disappointing film but it's an average film at best. I have never seen the cartoon version of the movie so I can't compare the two. It's probably better because they have a chance to explain the story more. The film is not that confusing but it's easy to get lost if you're not familiar with the material. The acting was alright  nothing special. Charlize Theron gives a good performance and seems dedicated to the film. The rest of the cast also give decent performances including Jonny Lee Miller  Frances McDormand and Marton Csokas. There are also more than a few interesting characters in the film including Sithandra  Aeon's friend.  The problem with Aeon Flux is that it takes itself too seriously. It carries the same serious tone throughout the entire film and that gets a little tiring. There's no humor and the film becomes a little boring at times. This is the same problem that Elektra had. Because the film is so serious  the dialog sounds cheesy and the serious scenes seem forced. The action scenes are pretty good but that's not what the film is really about so don't go in expecting just an action movie. The twist at the end isn't mind blowing but it's still a nice ending and better than other thrillers that have come out this past year (Hide and Seek). The costumes are little weird but still look nice and interesting. The visuals were are also done well so the film at least looks nice. So  the movie may be a case of style over substance. Interesting to look at but may not hold your attention for a very long time. In the end  it's not the best film out there but it might for a decent rental. Rating 4/10\n",

      "Well  they sent it on TV between midnight and 2:00 am - it seems like the right time to watch it  and then go to bed afterwards ...  No  it was not really living up to my expectations. I think the Dogma concept is good  because the film then gets closer to what's really happening between the involved characters when you cut all the unnecessary effects and mood-making music out. But then again  this concept requires some interesting action between the characters.  I cannot say  that I know King Lear (the Shakespeare version) very well  if I had known the play  I would probably have been able to predict much of the film.  Well  a crisis can bring the best and worst sides of a character on display - and we certainly see some bad sides. Oh yes  the paint of civilisation and culture can be very thin  and behind this paint you may find an animal.  If you then compare it with Italiensk for begyndere (Italian for beginners) or Mifunes sidste sang (Mifune's last song)  you see the same but opposite thing: A crisis can certainly bring people to view their life in a more constructive way. And if you dare do  you may win.  When the film had ended  I thought to myself: Oh that's why I haven't seen it before ... The film has its own beauty. The quality of the work of the cameraman  actors  etc is good. But the script could need something more. A plot maybe wouldn't hurt.\n",

      "I don't think it really matters too much what the plot of this movie is about  the main thing you'll notice is the extreme amateurishness of the entire production. The acting is what you'd get if you chose people at random off the street. The sound is really annoying - a medicine cabinet closes with all the gusto of a gunshot going off in your ear  while at the same time the dialog is perhaps one-fifth as loud. Miscellaneous on-set noises dominate the soundtrack to a huge degree  with dialog taking a distant back seat. The theme music sounds as if it was about a quarter done when the movie was released  as large portions of the film don't have any music at all. Camera-work can best be described as a gnarled mess  with close-up shots where a medium angle would be much better  cameramen walking around and jostling the camera every which way  absolutely no attention paid to framing any scene  they just shot everything from whatever position it was most convenient for the cameraman to stand. If the cameraman was a foot taller than the actors and you end up looking at the tops of everyone's heads  well  so be it. Editing is just a butcher job; Everything is tossed together in the most abrupt manner possible  nothing flows or transitions in any sense of the word. I don't know if this was shot on video or perhaps a rented camcorder  I tend to think it was the latter.   I only made it about three-quarters of the way through this thing before I turned it off  I just got so annoyed at the low quality of the production I couldn't take it anymore.

Having Sparrow narrate from the beginning also just completely destroyed the suspense for me.. i mean  if he's narrating the story  clearly he's lived to tell it  so there's no chance of him getting offed.. where's the suspense there?

It seems as if they needed a gimmicky hook to bait the audience into thinking there was some supernatural thing going on  when in the end it really didn't seem to have anything to do with anything.

      "Wow  this is anti-Christian bias big-time! This is based on a Stephen King novel and he written this kind of bias before and then Hollywood exaggerates it even more. In this film  we see a Protestant minister and a Catholic priest BOTH act like fools and be profane at the same time. Of course  the Devil has taken over the town so maybe his influence is into these guys  too  but they are typical Hollywood portrayals. They never show a minister who talks and acts like Billy Graham  or your local minister or priest. And - another given - they make the Satan character the most interesting of the film.   Max Von Sydow plays the Devil and makes him a likable guy. Ironically  Von Sydow has played a number of these roles after portraying Jesus in the 1964 film  The Greatest Story Ever Told. You wonder why actors are so screwed up? They don't know if they are God  Satan or anyone in between.  Ed Harris  who played a lot of unlikeable roles up until the last few years  is appropriately cast in this story. He and the rest of the mean-spirited characters in this film do NOT make it fun to watch.  From what I've heard  King's book is even darker and more sick than this hate-filled movie but better constructed. Frankly  who cares. King and Hollywood deserve each other.\n",

      "George and Mildred is a truly unfunny film. This attempt to translate the successful TV series to the big screen was a dismal failure  as is so often the case.  The wit and clever one-liners from the TV shows have gone missing. The plot is a typical English farce of confused characters and mistaken identities  which is neither funny enough nor weird enough to provoke many decent laughs.  Die-hard George and Mildred fans might want to see this final episode of the pair's output (Mildred died of hepatitis before the film was released)  but others should invest their time more wisely.\n",

      "In 1984  The Karate Kid had some charm to it  even if it was little more than a poor man's Rocky. Alas  producer Jerry Weintraub failed to realize it was best to leave the story at the point where it had ended  and convinced Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita to make an extra effort to turn the film into a trilogy. Part III was the definitive low in the franchise  yet someone must have thought the series still had some potential. What other explanation could there possibly be for the existence of The Next Karate Kid?  Wait a minute. Next? Yep  Macchio's gone (at least he was smart enough to stop eventually)  and his replacement is Hilary Swank (!)  playing a troubled teenager (what else?) named Julie Pierce. Now  the girl has family issues. She also gets in trouble at school. Said school has a sadistic gym teacher (Michael Ironside). As it turns out  though  one of his students is actually a nice guy  and Julie falls for him. This gets her in bigger trouble than before  of course. Lucky for her  she is currently living with Mr. Miyagi (Morita)  an old friend of her grandfather who happens to know how to get back at the bad guys.  All those factors ad up to seven clichés  and that's just a generic plot summary - imagine what the detailed scenes must be like! From beginning to end  The Next Karate Kid is a tired  flat and dull marathon of idiotic lines and set-ups. Swank does  thankfully  have the likes of Boys Don't Cry and Million Dollar Baby to redeem this disaster  but why did Morita accept to come back? He may have received an Oscar nomination for the first movie  and was quite enjoyable in the sequels  but has nothing to speak for him here - even the revival of the wax on  wax off gag is stillborn. As for Ironside  he is slightly better than Martin Kove and Thomas Ian Griffith in Part III  but that's hardly a stretch.  So  is this picture really that awful? Not exactly. There is one sequence that manages to achieve a weird beauty  but when the best bit in the whole film involves a group of Asian monks dancing as they hear pop music for the first time in their lives  it doesn't qualify as a recommendation to see the rest.\n",

      "During the 1990's  several attempts have been made to revive old Matsumoto's series. Yoshinobu Nishizaki tried to revive old Yamato saga in form of a laughably bad Yamato 2520  which was completely abandoned after mere two episodes. Captain Harlock suffered a confusing and pointless Harlock Saga  while Galaxy Express 999 suffered having this hack of a movie stapled to its name.  If you've seen Queen Millennia  you'll recall that it was a wonderful movie in its own way.

The only redeeming aspect of this movie is good artwork  but the remainder is so amazingly bad that it can't save this movie from being a total loss.

      "First of I should point out that I used to love Winnie The Pooh as a child and I really enjoyed The Tigger Movie even though I am in my 20's.  But this movie was so bad I was ashamed to have been a fan in my youth.  OK  OK I know this is a movie for kids and isn't aimed at people like me anyway but this is my thoughts on the movie for other people of my age.  The main downfall in this film is the heffalump itself  it has to be the most annoying character I have seen in a child's movie (possibly even more annoying then the young child in Monsters Inc). It has the most annoying voice and prattles around singing stupid things and making even more stupid comments  I know Pooh movies aren't exactly high brow but this was insulting to even a 2 year old's intelligence!  Secondly - where was the story? Previous Pooh outings had a least a point to the story- yes I can see this was about accepting people who are different to you into your hearts - but really it ended and I felt like I had watched a 5 minute cartoon on kids TV.  I don't have children of my own but when I do I fully intend to show them quality children's movies like The Tigger Movie  Toy Story and Finding Nemo (even though they are too childish for me these days I can see how they would be of great appeal to young children). Not so with this appalling attempt at a movie.  Oh and one more thing - NOT ENOUGH Eeyore! He should have his own movie!\n",

      "I seem to be disagreeing with a lot of folks here. but I really did not find this movie as scintillating as the reviews I read claimed. It was no doubt a touching story and the partition background provided the scope for an epic. but  the movie was a let down. specially for neone who has seen 'gadar'. inspite of the lead being played by sunny deol and the incessant songs  I must say gadar is the better of the two. the story being virtually the same. partition failed to create any depth in its characters as well as the scenes that were supposed to hav an impact. over looking kristin kruek's accent and the smallvile image  which in itself wasn't an easy job. the characters just did not seem too real. not that I am criticizing the acting by any of the lead. it just did not work. the atmosphere was well drawn up  but the movie really lacked in substance. not that I am die hard rambo fan  but some action cud have seen the movie through  or some character development. it all seemed like a rush to the finish. and the ending only added to the viewers dissatisfaction.  nonetheles  I must say that it was at least a good effort in seemingly unfamiliar territory by the director. and if U haven't seen gadar  then u mite even like it.\n",

      "This is a new approach to comedy. It isn't funny.  The joke is that this  in and of itself  is supposed to be funny.  The story is based on a French short story  located in Paris  and the characters have French names. Louis Aubinard  for example ... played by ... Bob Hoskins? The movie also stars the equally French Jeff Goldblum and Natasha Richardson. The situations are similar to and the characters perform as if in those Carry-On movies from years back.  I believe these are also jokes - to cast these actors who make no attempt to act French in any way  to have them cavort in the manner of broad English dance hall comedy  and to leave the whole bloomin' mystery unexplained to the audience.  In the humour department  this is practically the Algonquin Round Table  isn't it?  The movie tries to be charming and quirky  and I guess these characteristics are sort of funny. Not as funny as Duck Soup or Love and Death  perhaps  but funnier than The Deer Hunter or The Battleship Potemkin.  It is an example of personal filmmaking. It makes no real effort to reach out and share with the audience  but stays true to its premise and its internal logic. Although all the situations are unbelievable  they are logical within the film's own bizarro world.  I generally like this kind of eccentric movie  but I found this one to be paced too slowly  to be dull-witted  tedious  and to provide too few pleasurable surprises or genuine wit. It just kind of meanders in predictable and sophomoric ways  and wastes some wonderful talents along the way. It has to be the low point in the career of each of the major stars  who are all otherwise distinguished players. I found it to be the biggest waste of talent since The Betsy  and I wish I had never seen Goldblum and Hoskins in this thing.  So  call it an interesting miss  and pass on it as a rental unless you really have a lot of time to kill.  \n",

      "The Brotherhood of Satan is a stupefying combination of conventional horror elements mixed with some imaginative characterization and direction (Bernard McEveety). It all starts out with father Charles Bateman (as Ben) driving out west with his pretty blondes: luscious Ahna Capri (as Nicky)  and daughter Geri Reischl (as K.T.). Things get weirder and weirder for the trio  as they approach the town of Hillsboro  which is being gripped by a Satanic cult!   When the dullish travelers hit Hillsboro  the action switches to the film's more interesting assemblage of characters: townies L.Q. Jones (as Pete  the sheriff)  Strother Martin (as Doc)  Charles Robinson (as Jack  the priest)  and Alvy Moore (as Tobey). Their interplay is sometimes fun. Soon enough  it all gets very silly  and predictable. Mr. Martin is the stand-out (as you might expect); he considers the possibility of a Satanic cult to be a cock-and-bull story  but is (of course) their leader. The Come in  Children ending is puzzling; unless  perhaps  it was the film's original title.\n",

      "Mr. Brento wonders if this movie was produced by the same who produced the Dragonball Z TV series. Of course not.  This is a Hong Kong real action movie based on the first episodes of the Japanese original cartoon (which was also based on a comic book series). And I really don't know if it was produced under the license of the Dragonball creators...  However  the story of the monkey-boy with special powers is an ancient tale known all over Asia (in Japan  the name of the boy in the tale is Songoku; in China  it is Sunwukong; in Korea it is Sonogong; etc) and the story in Dragonball has much to do with that tale.  By the way  as I said  this movie is based on the first episodes of the Dragonball series (which was followed by Dragonball Z  although I think the US version had a different airing order). And all the scenes related to sexuality were also contained in the original cartoon series (without so much overacting and so much insistence on it!)  but because of your comments I may suppose they were completely removed in the American dubbing.  Anyway  I agree with you about the overacting in the film and about how poor this adaptation of the original cartoon is. But maybe because of that nobody can forget it after watching it...\n",

The music and cinematography is pretty good  but the special effects  at times  are terrible--rubber heads flying off with about the same realism as the average high school play! On top of these complaints  the ending of the movie completely DESTROYS and UNDERMINES the entire picture. It turns out that the end isn't true but was completely fudged.

      "From the epicenter of the cultural globe  four working class teenagers attempted to change the world through music and fashion. It was the final attempt to do so last century  and they failed. Before the dust had cleared  band manager and SEX shop proprietor Malcolm McLaren spent the money The Sex Pistols had earned to make a mockumentary about his own role in their success. The film was called The Great Rock 'n Roll Swindle (take the hint) and consists of very little footage of The Sex Pistols actually playing music  and quite a lot of footage of McLaren effectively calling the audience idiots.  Cod-surrealist nonsense in which guitarist Steve Jones is a detective on McLaren's tail  soon dissolves so he and drummer Paul Cook can jet off to Rio and spend time with great train robber Ronnie Biggs. Ready yourself for the spectacle of three very unappealing men dancing naked to a hideous irony-free version of Belsen was a Gas (a song about killing Jews for gold in Bergen-Belsen concentration camp)  and another song sung in Ronnie's tone deaf whine which includes the lyrics God save Myra Hindley  God save Ian Brady (lyrics that Johnny Rotten would have considered distasteful). The Sid Vicious scenes are few and idiotic. Jumping out of bed in a thong with a swastika over the testicles to sing some bad boy biker song from the '50s. Playing into to the Punk's a joke theme of the movie  in an attempt to turn Sid into James Dean. I'm surprised McLaren doesn't take credit for Siddy's death too. The redeeming scenes are those of Sid in Paris and the infamous performance of My Way. The punk rock zeitgeist right there. Mocking an adoring audience before shooting them all. No need for an entire film  just watch that clip on YouTube.  From Julien Temple's far superior (and more enjoyable) 2001 documentary followup  The Filth and the Fury  we were given a more balanced/honest view of what transpired in '78. But there were also a number of scenes that I would have liked to have seen in Swindle (as Fury was basically a reediting of the same material). One was an animated Sid complete with Sid's voice acting; You f*cken betta wat'ch out  alright  or I'll slice you open - a still of which appeared on the cover of the Something Else 7 inch - a snippet was shown in Fury  but I don't know what context that originally appeared. Was it in original prints  but removed after Sid's death? Was there more? Fury also shed light on the film Who Killed Bambi  which would have been the mock Hard Day's Night movie McLaren was originally intending to make. It starred Sting(!) as a member of a gay New Romantics group  and looked a damn sight more entertaining than Swindle.  Sod Swindle  t'is a swindle. If you must  rent The Filth and The Fury and revel in music's failure as a world changing polemic.\n",

I'm a big fan of those two movies and seeing scenes taken from them  re-edited and re-dubbed with nonsensical dialogue made my head spin. These kind of cheap producers tactics to make more money by duping unsuspecting audiences basically killed the Sword & Sandal genre back in the 1960s.  There is one memorable scene in the new footage and it's the one when Hercules fights with the bad Hercules.

      "Kasparov vs. Deep Blue is no doubt a fascinating story  but I don't think you'd know it by watching this movie. I think it focuses too much on the conspiracy theory that IBM cheated...and what does this theory hinge upon? The idea that at one point the computer made a move that looked human. I am not a chess grandmaster or a computer scientist. And while I don't doubt that the move looked human  to me it doesn't seem beyond the realm of possibility that the most powerful chess-playing computer ever created could make a surprising move...or that such a machine could beat even a genius like Kasparov. The movie gets way too much mileage out of this theory  and not enough out of the personalities of the people involved...that could have made it a much more interesting story. The direction also relies way too much on the conceits of a pointlessly whispered narration  and the imagery of an 18th century chess-playing machine that looks like one of those animatronic gypsy fortunetellers you see at the carnival. Also the story was slowed down by many empty shots of Kasparov revisiting the scene of the crime. I don't doubt that Kasparov and the chess community found IBM's behavior vexing  but I don't think it's any different than you would find from any other big corporation. At the end of the movie  you are left with the feeling that Kasparov is a huge crybaby and the Deep Blue programmers are either victims or cheats. I think if the filmmaker wanted the viewer to believe the conspiracy theory (which he almost certainly did)  he should have presented a lot more evidence. In fact  more evidence would have been a good idea in the first place. The whole thing left me with a sour taste in my mouth.\n",

Now the story though may seem gripping to start with but once watching this bloated and un-original blood fest it develops into a mash of bitter blood and a forceful film.  It's directing is on par of average and by no means the standards of what a South Korean thriller should be. Oldboys acting scenes are paralleled with dull humour and a poorly writtern script.  Oldboy is occasionlly presented with thin straw performances that one could only feel shameful about.

I feel that the movie left out several key elements and missed some of the main points from the book. In addition  the actors were boring and lacked originality and enthusiasm.  The book  while not an adventure story or easy to understand  is full of hidden meaning and interesting twists in the plot. The book  though very confusing and complex  is astonishing. When you do finally understand it  you feel as if you have actually learned something. The novella  or short story  had several key ideas like futility and craziness  which the movie left out. In addition  several key scenes were changed  which in return affected the entire plot. Many of the scenes seemed to be very choppy  in the sense that they did not fit together. In summary  the movie seemed to be a bad interpretation of the book.   I would only recommend watching this movie if you cannot picture or understand the book  but otherwise I would skip this one. It was dreadful  and in complete disarray. If you have never read the book then  definitely do not watch the movie because you need the basic information from the book to understand the movie.

While watching this movie  which she had seen twice already  I realized how far this fandom goes. Probably far enough to rate this movie above a 1/10  as some people miraculously did.  The movie attempts to be a parody of many other movies and series  most notably Cast Away  Lost and Jurassic Park. Unfortunately  it fails miserably at any level. The acting does not save the absolutely horrible story  the filming has the quality of a too-often played video tape  the special effects were better executed in Be Kind Rewind (for those who do not now this movie: with aluminum foil)... All this would be funny if the movie managed to be  well  funny. Unfortunately  it is not. It hurts to watch this.  And then there is Michael Jacksons appearance in this garbage. He appears on a projection screen to deliver an important message  and manages to come across as mobile as Jabba the Hutt and as serious as a 4-year old. Just when I thought who is the terrible person that lured this poor man into participating in this movie and yet again making a total fool of himself  I (finally) reached the ending credits and discovered that the movie was actually partially shot at Jackson's Neverland ranch.

Let me first say that the movie deserves some credit for having an immensely insane and retarded plot. I mean  a mutant killer snowman on a tropical island that spawns mutant killer baby snowballs which can only be killed or harmed by bananas??? As much as I love the premise  I really hated the movie. First of all: while the first JACK FROST looked like an actual movie (seemingly being shot on real film and all)  this sequel has the look and feel of a third-rate soap-opera. It has this way too slick shot-on-video look. The lighting is just plain awful (bright white spots for the day look  and stupid colors like blue and green at night). The acting... well don't even go there. The dialogues range from stiff to extremely senile (that Jamaican man was just moronic  saying man after every sentence). And when it comes to the voice of the killer snowman  all I could think of was a seventh-rate Chucky from CHILD'S PLAY spewing dumb and supposedly witty one-liners before he kills someone.  The best joke was were one guy asks Why are you talking to your watch?. And the best scene was undoubtedly the one with that beautiful Asian chick popping up out of nowhere and taking a swim in the pool totally naked (thank god for that!). Oh  yeah  and that little scene over the end-credits with those two Japanese dudes on a miniature ship being badly dubbed had me laughing too. But the worst thing about this movie was: Where was the gore and splatter action everyone is talking about? There were plenty of occasions to show some decent gory killings. A lot of people were killed off in original ways here  but all off-screen. Like I've read in many other comments  there were indeed nice set-ups to a head explosion  a crushed body  eyes being poked out  tongue ripped out ... but on the crucial moments the editor cuts away to some blood splatters on the floor or nothing at all. That frontal shot of that British guy being impaled (from the back-cover of the DVD) wasn't even in the movie. I only saw that particular killing filmed from the back (meaning I didn't see sh!t!). I was waiting throughout the whole movie for that to happen  and then I get to see nothing?!?! What a let-down! Could it be that I saw a cut version of the movie? That would be a shame  'cause only a decent amount of splatter-fun could have saved this movie if you ask me. Seeing a lot of killer snowballs reduced to bloody pulp just didn't cut it for me. Speaking of those snowballs: they were done very poorly. They made MUNCHIES look like state-of-the-art 'animatronics'. But I guess that was the whole point of it. At some point  the special effects crew even turned to some laughably bad CGI. Boy  you really have to see it to believe it. Best is to not see it  actually  'cause this flick is just too bad (okay  I did laugh with it  for it kept getting worse and worse). Just stick with the first JACK FROST (1996) and you'll be okay (just bare in mind that it's a pretty silly horror-comedy but fun in it's own right).  It's funny  but writer/director Michael Cooney somehow must have realized that he was a pretty bad director after JACK FROST 2  and then focused on writing. Turns out he then wrote two pretty good thriller screenplays for THE I INSIDE (starring Ryan Phillippe) and IDENTITY (starring John Cusack). So the man seems to have some talent after all.  Now it would be far too easy to give JACK FROST 2 the lowest rating possible. So I say one point for that naked Asian babe doing the skinny dipping and one point for those completely retarded snowball babies. Way to go Mr. Cooney!\n",

      "I love old monster movies for the pure camp value. This one does not disappoint if you find that sort of thing amusing.  The acting is pure 1950s stilted crap. You do get used to it when you've seen enough of these... the dialogue is very silly and ultimately forgettable. You're just there for the giant bird.  The science in this movie is hilarious. A monstrous otherworldly avian that can manipulate anti-matter... intent on wreaking havoc and eating people... an alien who has come to Earth to nest. Some of the best scenes in the movie (that don't have the bird in them) include the scientists explaining what is going on.  A lot has been said about the ridiculous bird marionette. It looks like a new baby bird... bald and ugly with ruffled feathers. It even caws like a hungry  angry fledgling. However  the bird scared the crap out of my three year old  who had big scary bird nightmares for the evening. It's a bit creepy.  I was very sad about the scene where they shoot the egg. (Somehow the egg is not protected by an antimatter shield.) But I'm a bird lover  what can I say?\n",

      "This movie starts off promisingly enough  but it gets a little to convoluted and caught up in its stylistic charm. The set designs  costumes  and music were wonderful- as close to perfect as one can get. But the more I got into the movie  the more I felt like all this effort was for the director's entertainment  not the audience. Although  I loved looking at it  except for a few brief musical scenes  I can't say I enjoyed it. The director shows enormous imagination  but if he had fun with this film  he failed to share that with the audience  or at least with me. I didn't get a sense of whimsy and I didn't get sucked into this universe.  A big cause of this was (surprisingly) Zhang Ziyi. You can tell she's trying very hard  but she seems to have been so miscast that she comes off almost amateurish. She's a capable actress but she has her limitations. I've noticed in her acting  that she has yet to truly react to her fellow co-stars  a flaw that creates a void of chemistry. The language barrier in this film seems to have only exacerbate matters. She and Odagiri act as if they're on separate planets. She's also not a very good singer which made me cringe every time she sang  but thankfully there weren't too many scenes of that. Odagiri was OK but doesn't make much of an impression.  I didn't even care for the characters separately. There really is a sore lack of characterization. The only reason to care about them seems to be that they're good-looking royalty. Without the compelling love story at the center of the film though  it's hard to care what happens. The film also takes detours into minor scenes that added nothing to the story and was actually distracting. I had to rewind because after going into a subplot I couldn't remember what the heck they we're doing in the main storyline. There were also scenes where it was hard to tell what the action occurring was because it was so stylized.  Mostly I'm just disappointed because I really like the concept behind this and there are a lot of things I do like. The music and dance choreography are really great.The supporting performances are uniformly excellent  fantastic in both the acting aspect and the singing. It's just too bad the lead actors were so bland.\n",

      "This is strictly for Pryor fans. Just because he was a great  funny guy doesn't mean this is more than a B-Movie. The script is awful  it just meanders around constantly ridiculing crime and prisoners of war. It balances between comedy and melodrama and keeps falling on its face doing justice to neither.   First there are 30 minutes of rather unrealistic  uninspired Vietnam prisoner of war time  the guy is playing basketball at one point... How more can you pander to your audience?... That prison time is boring  unconvincing and already can easily put one to sleep.   Back in the U.S. the guy for no real reason at all is considered a war hero. Yet he is of course quickly forgotten by the public and seems to be stumbling into all kinds of wacky mishaps. Or are they really? We will soon find out. Yawn. There are annoying clichés: his sick mother  his little daughter he never meets  a high end whore falling in love with the hero etc. It is very odd how this movie constantly switches from tragedy to slapstick in one instant. Doesn't work at all.   Overall this in fact is just a bad comedy and does a disservice to prisoners of war. Just because this guy was a great stand-up comedian  played in a few good movies and died of MS is no reason not to be annoyed by this silly  unconvincing  unfunny comedy. But if you like Richard Pryor you will probably be thrilled by him reading 3 hours of Dadaist poetry.\n",

      "This is just one of those movies that continually make you groan and that I wished was over. The problems are many and the good points are few. I feel the main problem with this movie is that it has what amounts to a cheesy plot and they try to make it out to be a epic movie  which a movie about super evil monkeys and smart ones that sign just is not epic  it is cheese. When you have cheese you make the movie more fun. Granted  the final scene with the monkeys and that laser was very nice to watch and more of things of that nature was needed. Instead the actors are doing such a serious job that you feel the movie just has a corny plot amid all the serious tension the movie is trying to set up. The plot revolves around a woman trying to find what happened to her missing ex-husband while also searching for some sort of legendary diamonds. She uses these two guys who trained an ape to do sign language and now wish to return her to the wild as cover to get into the country and begin the mediocre adventure of a lifetime. The only things that make this movie somewhat tolerable is Ernie Hudson's character and the laser attack at the end.\n",

      "It is such a shame that so many people love Family Guy  because it is easily one of the worst shows on TV  there are many points to address here.   The Flashbacks: Now  in Season 1 and 2  which I think was exceptional  the flashbacks were quite frequent  and actually somewhat tied into what the plot was about and was even funny. Now season 4 and on  the flashback s are even more occurring  and has NOTHING to do with the plot  aren't funny  and really long  boring  and meaningless. Family Guy thinks that long drag scene which go nowhere are funny  when really it is poor writing.  Stewie: Wow  a baby that sounds British. How funny can that be? It's not. His character is so unstable it's unbelievable. Remember in the early season's when Stewie was all about world domination and killing Lois. Well now he just has scene's that are awkwardly gay with Brian. From wanting world domination to being gay = bad writing.  References: How do they manage to keep making poor references to 80's TV shows or events? Well they just re-use the same old garbage. You know  in 20 years  hopefully Family Guy will be canceled by then  if they are still doing jokes about shows from the 80's  it will be even more irrelevant than it was before. Because will have forgotten. This still keeps me wondering why they can't just writ good episodes with quality jokes.  Voice Acting: My God  the voices in this show is so poor. Seth McFarlene should just focus on his crappy episode writing and stop doing voices. All the extras in the already bad Family Guy episodes all sound the same. The Simpsons get 6 or 7 people to do ALL the voices. A few of them are voicing about 15-20 characters...all sounding very different. But why can't Family Guy do that? Oh right  it's a crappy show.  The Stuttering: Usually done by peter  Stewie  Brian and any extras  whenever they talk or are offended by something  they have to stutter out their sentence's just to try get a cheap laugh. I can't believe that Family Guy can't even speak normally to get people to laugh at their jokes.  Offensiveness: OK  short and simple  Family Guy tries to break the barrier and be cutting edge  but really they fall flat every time. Go watch South park...  Terrible Plots: The plots and story lines are just utter trash. The Simpsons have started their 20th seasons are STILL have better plots than Family Guy. About a total of 8 or 9 minutes is flashbacks and drag scenes which have no relevance.   Popularity Lots of little kids have Stewie shirts and think hes so funny  when really they don't even get the terribly written sex jokes. They just say  oh  ha ha  stewie! when they don't even get it. Family Guy has gotten canceled twice  and brought back by DVD sales  how sad is that. They got canceled the first time I think after the 2nd or 3rd season  and I honestly believe  that shoulda been it. those episodes back then were superb  they shoulda left on a high note.  Drag Scenes and Falling There are scenes that go on way too long. One that just aired this last Sunday  Peter went to an executive bathroom  in which about 2 minutes was spent imitating the intro to Jurassic park  and the plot of that episode is stolen from a Seinfeld episode as well. Also a scene when Chris is working at a store and hes talking with the employee for about 5 minutes about a movie  which also features the stuttering. THE CHICKEN FIGHTS ARE SO STUPID  3 of them  each one longer then the last. useless  unfunny writing  thinking that people enjoy long scenes of rerun fighting  between a CHICKEN  yeah a chicken. now  every time someone falls down  and by the way  NO FAMILY GUY FAN CAN DENY THIS  that every time they fall down  its under a split second  and they ALWAYS land with their arm over their back to make them look funny i guess  its been used at least 30 times.  Herman Oh jeez  everyone thinks the old pedophile is so funny when its just a really bad running gag. they've even gone to lengths of giving him singing scenes (which are very poor) and basing ENTIRE episodes around him  they've done the same thing with other characters  like the doctor  who I know has had an episode based around him.  The Simpsons Well  not much explanation needed here. There is so much evidence of Family guy stealing Simpson's jokes. How family guy is just a poor mans Simpsons.  so Im sure I've forgotten some key points somewhere  but Im sure this is enough to prove that family guy is really a terrible horribly written TV show that everyone seems to love  when really they should go watch Simpson's  Seinfeld  and Frasier.\n",

      "This film should be called adventures in Cinemascope. It is like the screenwriter and director tooks the Cliff's Notes page 3 outline and decided that this would be a great vehicle for a film about the Italian Alps. Rock Hudson is pretty good here  but the dialogue bears no resemblance to Hemingway at all. This is a made up version of Hemingway. Hecht  the screenwriter  is a hack. Watch the 1932 version with Gary Cooper and Helen Hayes. That is great cinema and was made by someone who understood Hemingway and the war in Northern Italy. Gary Cooper is very  very good compared to his performance in For Whom the Bell Tolls where he is stiff as a board and thinks he is in a western.  Anyway  if you are a Hemingway fan  do yourself a favor and do not watch this film. Your best bet is to get the unabridged audio CD and just listen to one of the greatest novels ever written.\n",

      "It was only a matter of time that a spoof would be made of sports movies! And there are plenty of movies to be spotted which are made fun off. But the biggest problem I had was the fact that it stays with recognizing movies. The director and writers of The Comebacks somehow forget to get creative. While I must admit that I laughed at certain scenes The Comebacks could have been so much funnier. The actors forget to deliver their lines seriously and have a straight face throughout the movie. A spoof demands this and that is the main reason why silly jokes work in movies like this. Because of the failure of the cast to do so the jokes never hit their mark. Some scenes take forever and normally in spoofs that doesn't have to be a problem. Take Naked Gun for instance. Their is always something happening on screen. In The Comebacks they didn't even bother to let stuff happening in the background. Only a couple of factors make this movie worth watching! It still is fun to spot the movies that are made fun off. And Jermaine Williams as Ipod. His parody on Cuba Gooding Jr. as Radio was hilarious! He seemed to be the only one in the cast to get the idea of what a spoof is about. Not entirely bad!\n",

      "Great Balls of Fire is the movie you show to someone you really  really hate. It is absolute torture of the highest rank and is probably used by minions of a foreign power to extract info from captured intelligence agents. I've enjoyed some of Dennis Quaid's performances in the past  but he goes totally over the top in this film. He doesn't so much cross the line  he pole vaults over it  then comes back to jump over and over again. He struts and mugs as if on some incredibly bad acid trip. It's one of those rare performances where you wish you could enter the film and beat the man within an inch of his life for doing something so truly awful. Was he desperate to win a Golden Raspberry or some other award for bad acting? That's the only conclusion I can come up with. Thank you Dennis  you gave us a bad performance for the ages. Where was the director to reign in this guy?  The opposite end of the extreme is Winona Ryder  she of the plastic features and plastic acting. I came across a review of her acting style that compared her to a wax dummy. That was of course an insult to wax dummies all over the earth  all of whom could have brough more humanity to the role of Jerry's underage cousin/wife. This brings up the film's mixed up message  that being it is 100% okay to marry your own cousin and have a child by the union. I fail to see what is so okay about that  but it looks as though Hollywood thinks that underage incest is hunky dory. Talk about family values.  Another problem is the format. Is it a stright forward re telling of Lewis' life  or is it a musical? I'm not talking about the music  I'm talking about the truly weird scene where Jerry drives up to the school  starts to belt out a tune and everyone starts to dance like it was Broadway musical in search of a Tony. Fantasy and reality are thrown together in a mix that does not work. But who really cares? I don't. And neither should you. You can't get back the minutes of life you would waste on this film.

Mencia tells used  worn out racial jokes in a bad attempt at being controversial  then will point out the ethnicity he just talked about in the audience as if to say 'they liked it  so all of your race likes it  and by extension me too'. Give me a break Mencia  I don't know if those people are plants or not  but just because you go to a black guy and high five him after one of your ridiculous jokes  doesn't mean he thinks you're funny  it just means you put him on the spot and what else is he going to do  smack you on TV? He gives the impression that his jokes are deep  meaningful  and thought provoking  which is apparent in his commercials  but when you actually watch the show almost 100% of what he says is common sense. He also claims that only smart people get some of his jokes  but you don't have to be any smarter than a monkey to understand what he just said when he says that  maybe you need to go finish 3rd grade Carlos. The guy goes on to say that he says what others are only thinking  but I think you'll find that if anyone was thinking what he says  they figured out all on their own that it was ridiculous  and that's why they never said it in the first place.  All in all  watch 1 episode and be done with it if you must  because after you've seen 1 episode  you've seen them all. Why Comedy Central keeps renewing this horrible show is well beyond me.

Apart from an introduction to the history of the 18 weapons style told by a monk to some children during the opening and the usual mysterious manual that everyone is after  the weapons never really appear again and the fights are all boxing style. The hero is Lee Shao Hwa who I have never heard of before or any of the other actors. The film mentions another director Wu Yuen Ling as well as the one IMDb lists. The other actors are Wang Fu Quen  Wang Wing San  Chen Fei Fei  Wang Ki San  Suen King Kai and Hwa Yue Suen who seem to have sunk without trace after this film. The fights are reasonable and frequent but not great and the 'star' doesn't have much charisma. The twist at the end is just stupid and the film seems to end abruptly as though they got bored with it. The scenery and the training sequences in the river are a little different from usual. Unfortunately the pretty sister gets drowned not the very irritating (though acrobatic) young boy.\n",

      "I don't normally write reviews  but this film was special. I couldn't turn it off. I don't believe I've ever seen a worse movie  but there I sat  watching. It was like a horrible car wreck with blood flowing all over the highway. It was disgusting  but I couldn't turn away. Where do I start? The movie seems to think it's a sports thriller  but it's so utterly ridiculous  it can only be a comedy  but it's not funny  not even in a dumb/silly way. It's like watching your cousins try to act out a skit on family get-togethers. It's painful to watch  but at least it's only for a minute or two. Second String went on for over an hour.   Whoever was involved with making this movie should not work again. The writing  directing  acting  and everything was just terrible. The problem is I can't describe how bad it was; you just had to see it. And I'm sure this will NEVER be shown again  so unless you saw it  you're out of luck. I mean it was almost worth seeing just for the fact that it gave me some appreciation for every other bad film I've seen over my lifetime. And for every film I see in the future that I can't stand  I will think to myself  well  at least it wasn't bad as the Second String.\n",

      "This is an oft-used line  but it really sums up this movie...If this is the current state of gay cinema  then we're in real trouble. I saw this film at SIFF because of the high IMDb rating (7.6) and if there was ever a case of vote stacking on IMDb  then this is it. Just watch the number fall over the release weeks of the film.  Easy plot...Boy finds out his high school ex (boyfriend) is getting married to a female friend of theirs so he goes back to his old hometown (still carrying a 10 year old torch) to see what happened.  First off  I liked Latter Days  the director's last feature  despite its cookie cutter characters and plot contrivances  but you're supposed to become a better director with each subsequent release. I don't know how you get horrible supporting performances out of so many TV veterans (Robert Foxworth  Joanna Cassidy  Tori Spelling)  but somehow he managed to. The writing was Lifetime Network quality (way back when they were REALLY bad) and the situations were unbelievable AND uncomfortably hard to watch. I kept reaching for a non-existent remote control to fast forward  but ultimately made myself stay to the end  hoping for a decent ending. Ugh...no. Even the gratuitous male nudity that popped up during the movie was so blatantly gratuitous that it seemed to be there to keep people in their seats.   To be fair...the 2 leads  especially in the gratuitous nude scenes  were gorgeous. There was also a real sweetness between them during their rekindling friendship as they uncovered how they went separate ways. And the film looked great...good quality and color saturation for an independent film.  How is it that network TV can give week after week of great  entertaining weekly episodes (Like Ugly Betty  Desp. Housewives  etc.)  but so many feature releases in similar genres can be as bad as this?\n",

      "I'm sorry to say that this movies was one of the biggest disappointments of the year. Following one of the biggest disappointments in movie monster match up history you would think that they would learn from the mistakes of the previous incarnation. The sequel falls into many of the same traps  the plot line was completely forced  the dialog was so bad that the film might be better on mute  and the action was contrived and far from the heart pounding brilliance of each monsters original films. The best part of AVP-Requiem is in fact the trailer  which as you go through the movie end up realizing that almost every single death and every really cool shot in the movie was already shown in the trailer which leaves little to be revealed and little to be excited about. I gave the movie an extra star for letting see the extra hot female in the almost nude. the movie played out like a color-by-number sci-fi monster fest which also played into the fact that nothing was a surprise when it happened  because you'd seen it a thousand times before. the main failing with both these movies is that the creators thought that setting the films in our time would make us be interested in the story more as if it may one day happen to us. but what drew people in when they released the arcade game back in the day was that it kinda took place within an over the top futuristic version of the ALIEN trilogy time line which allowed more of a suspension of disbelief. this is where the future movies need to draw inspiration from. because to be honest  seeing a waitress killed by the ALIEN we all have feared since childhood just really doesn't do it for us. lets take the series back to its roots. learn from the former masters and don't mess with a winning formula by trying to make a 'bold new vision' we liked the originals for a reason  we want to see that again. Lastly  the ending is the real WTF moment of the whole film  *SPOILER* after the big climax  the survivors are ambushed by Special-Ops soldiers who justify their horrific actions by saying 'we were following orders' and then turn on a dime and start acting all nice and are turned into saviors. then after the long pull back with one of the survivors looking ominously into the heavens  we cut to the most bizarre cliffhanger I've ever seen  with characters you never saw in the rest of the movie (Save the Government Dude) then with all the subtlety of a punch to the face they reveal that there will be yet another film with the hint of a plot line that would make a sci-fi channel original movie blush and turn up its nose. So  in summation  if you have to choose between this movie and doing any other activity on the face of the Earth  skip the movie and do the other thing instead.\n",

      "In trying to keep up with the hipness of youthful audiences as the 70s approached  OaCD YCSF was the product of odder and odder material selected for musicalization. Here it's past life regression  ESP and hypno-therapy... pretty loopy! The real problem with the concept (music or not) are the extraordinarily low dramatic stakes; just where can a movie go  and what can happen  when a man falls in love with a previous incarnation of a girl he can't stand? It can't go any place new  but strangely  it can't even go any place old! Indeed  if it could  audiences would still have no interest in the union of Yves Montand (playing a much older  arrogant  French ass) and Streisand. (a much younger girl). We never become invested in them  their situations or outcomes. Montand is miscast and his strong accent makes many of his lyrics unintelligible.  It's all been given a shallow 60s veneer that makes it eminently disposable; despite efforts here and there from Minelli that are respectable. It's not even adapted from a non-musical story that met with any previous success... that's just too passe! Streisand occasionally has some funny business to offer  as when she's trying not to fall asleep on her roof and improvises an energetic dance. But she over-relies on her ingratiating (translation: irritating) kooky  Jewish girl shtick. She can however sing very well  at both the gentle and powerhouse ends of the range. Amidst a score of musical dross  she gets 3 or 4 amazing songs* of much higher caliber than anything Fanny or Dolly had to offer. 'He isn't you' is a sweet trifle as sublime as Lorenz Hart's 'My Funny Valentine ' but the movie isn't able to realize any impact from it; because the lyrics don't seem to be referring to anything in the movie  and nothing remotely suggests a great love is blossoming between Chabot and Melinda.  The only cut we can view is a poor hatchet job of a much bigger film. Strong research shows a longer  better-explained and more decorative  but not necessarily a better film at: http://barbra-archives.com/films/clear_day_streisand_2.html. You can be sure there's be more Babs in that version but more importantly  there'd be more thoughtful work from Minelli.  In the end Montand sends Babs off to sing the title song  after she discovers he's a total dick who feeds her a self-esteem homily to allow himself off the hook. And she takes the bait. So  uh... hooray for that.  (*Hurry it's lovely up here  Love with all the trimmings  He isn't you  & the title song)\n",

It is not memorable enough to add to your collection  and I have a considerable amount of noirs.  Paul Henreid plays a tough guy in here. He's not one I would think of to play this kind of role  but he's fine with it. He's a fine actor  anyway.  Everything  including the cinematography  is okay-but-not memorable. One thing that stood out: the abrupt ending. That was a surprise. It was also a surprise to see this under the heading Hollow Triumph. I've never seen the film called that.

When I first heard about this movie  people on IMDb were classifying it as the sequel to Cheerleader Camp. Oh how wrong they were. Yes  Betsy Russell was in it but Uma Thurman sure wasn't. I'd really like to find the person who started that whole sequel rumor. I'm sure a lot of us would though. I'm not gonna give anything away because frankly I don't remember how this movie even ends!

After seeing the 1999 version and reading the book  I decided to watch the older version. I found it did stay true to Fanny character in the book  but it was also boring character. Fanny character played by Sylvestra Le Touzel was lackluster; she often appeared to be about to faint. I also did not like Robert Bourbage who played Henry Crawford. I could not imagine him being interested in Fanny or her cousin Maria. Jackie Smith Wood who played Mary Crawford was okay but the wig she wore was so ugly. I lost interested in her acting and I kept staring at her wig. I kept expecting it would drop off her head. I could also see a slip of her real hair under the wig.\n",

      "I just watched this movie last night. Within 30 minutes of the start  I was hoping it would end.  It had a promising beginning; the first 10 minutes. The premise of this movie (friendship that goes nowhere after they've spent days (and Years) together in Separate beds in hotel rooms) is just not believable. He does kiss her somewhere along the way  and she feels Ohh  so terrible about it.   Very little substance to grab your interest. The acting just does not hold up. He is very passive. Regardless of how much of the movie is shown  the viewer never develops any type of a caring connection with the characters on the screen. You learn that her next utterance will be as boring as her previous one. (Do you have a cigarette ?  He doesn't smoke  He wants her to stop smoking  Doesn't she know this by now.)  She calls him in the middle of the night to visit him after a year's absence  she comes in through the door  they don't even hug or kiss or express any type of emotional connection. He doesn't even lean forward to lift her suitcase to help her in. That is not how real people behave  This is not how best pals behave.  When he receives her phone call in the middle of the night (she is in town for one day)  he shows little interest to see her face  acts more like she will be a burden for the night. At this point they've known each other for two years and he hasn't seen her for a year. Not Believable  not real.   Supposedly  he has written a book on Entropy and Enthalpy  yet we never see him write or read or discuss any of his interests in Physics with her  not that she would be able to handle the discussion. We learn that a watermelon in L.A. costs $50  (It wasn't the Silicon Type mind you) he has no problem affording that Fruit. We also learn that the airport shuts down when a few really really fake snow flakes fall off the sky. I'm Sorry but was that in L.A. too?  We never see how these two characters survive  we never see them at work. We never see them struggle  They are always on vacation. They have infinite time  they have no worries whatsoever.

      "It's difficult to find anything worth of praise with this movie. It's not the worst picture ever made  but that's not saying a whole lot. The plot is quite incoherent and unbelievable; it seems that the producers wanted to make a space movie  but decided to make it underwater to cash in at the success of The Abyss. In some scenes it seems as if the story indeed was set to outer space initially; the sub has a landing gear  the technicians are worried of a rip in a rubber diving suit at the depths of several kilometers  where the pressure would crush the diver and the suit like an empty beer can.   The movie starts out okay  with planning of a recovery of a lost naval sub. After that the movie takes a plunge along with the Siren 2.  Effects are so-so. The navigational screens are all done on Commodore 64 (remember  this is 1990  not 1983)  the sub is controlled like no other sub ever; instead of control consoles  the officers have keyboards with which they enter long number sequences to control various functions of the ship. The interior of the ship isn't too convincing either.  The final scenes leap from awkward to absurd. Welcome to the fifties  you can check your suspension of disbelief at the door.  I fail to see enjoyment factor here. The movie is neither good nor hilariously bad MST3k-style (until you get to the final scene)  it's like eating a slightly bad apple.\n",

      "I suppose I'm supposed to take something like this with a grain of salt. These laboratory movies (and  yes  they spend a lot of time in the laboratory)  always fail in one dimension: there is an understanding that single people fooling around have uncovered secrets beyond the comprehension of anyone to this time. Of course  they pay a price because their experimenting has the same shortcomings that Dr. Frankenstein's did. There is always something they didn't anticipate. There are so many things from pure science to fashion for young ladies to outrageous cover ups that don't work here. The young woman is certainly fetching and the doctor can't help himself  but he could have been a little bit discreet or even made an effort to shelter what he was doing. Things go wrong and because of this intellect  she gains tremendous power  including an understanding of how she came to be. Rock Hudson looks pretty fit here. He never quite makes it in this role  however. It wanders all over with lots of clichés and silliness which diminishes the basic issue. Once she has her revenge a more suitable thing would be for her to wander off and allow him to seek her out and destroy her in some grand way.\n",

It literally took me almost 4 hrs in total to watch because I had to take a break and restart my brain to semi-normal functionality every so often. I mean this movie goes soooooo slooooow its ridiculous  to say that the script had about 10 pages of dialogue would be generous. They just don't talk!!

All in all  if you need something to calm yourself down  just play the movie  dont even start at the beginning if you've seen it before  just start anywhere  lay down  and relax  it'll put you right to sleep.\n",

      "* Terrible * * Below Par * * * Not Bad * * * * Good * * * * * Brilliant  WARNING *MINOR SPOILERS*  Homosexuality these day's is hardly the taboo subject it was over forty years ago.However it must be said that perhaps more so in America than say  over here in the U.K. it can still be a touchy subject.Just look at the whole debacle of gay's in the millitary some years ago in the US.It's with 'In and Out' that writer Paul Rudnick taps in to the small town mentality of middle America and the way the press in the US (As well as in the UK) make such a big deal in outing a celebrity.You need only look at when Will Young and Stephen Gately of Boyzone came out of the closet.  The movie centres on Howard Brackett(Kevin Kline)  a High school English teacher in his home town.The local people are preparing themselves for Oscar night as one of the nominees Cameron Drake(Matt Dillon) came from their town and was a former pupil of Howards. Cameron  who plays a gay soldier in a vietnam epic wins the award only to out Howard as being gay during his acceptance speech.This could not come at a worse time for Howard who is just day's away from marrying his fiance and fellow school teacher Emily(Joan Cusack).As you would expect the media reaction is cataclysmic and turn's Howards life upside down.Not only does he try to convince his family and friends that he is not gay but evade sleazy news reporter  Peter Malloy(Tom Selleck).  Although this was billed as a screwball comedy it's clear that Rudnick and director Frank Oz are also attempting to be satirical.You only have to look at the early scenes at the Oscars cerimonee and the way the people of Bracketts home town as well as the teaching board of the school react to his outing.  Sadly the film doesn't live up to the promise we see early on in the movie.This is a pretty flat attempt to make social commentary out of a wacky comedy.A good cast is sadly wasted on a script that never really delivers the nessecary amount of laughs and is no where near as insightful as it thinks it.  Kline gives us the same kind of endearing performance that he gave us in his earlier comedy 'Dave'  making Howard an instantly likeable character. Cusack too is good value as Howard's weight obsessed fiance while Tom Selleck play's very well against type as a gay news reporter.Bob Newhart is a joy also  as the principal of the high school where Howard works.It's great to see him on the big screen for a change.It's a shame that it had to be this.  The performances as good as they are can do little to rescue the movie from being a rather dull affair.While a couple of scenes do offer some amusement.Namely the inspired scene where Howard attempts to make himself seem more manly by listening to a self help tape.There is little to enjoy  and when things can't seem to get any worse Rudnick resorts to a sickening finale that lurches in to over the top sentiment. I also couldn't help but feel that my intelligence was being insulted.Malloy appears to be too sleazy a character to become the man who put's his ethics before getting a good story while Cammeron finally come to the rescue in the film's climax seems at first to be too self involved a character to care a jot about what happens to his former teacher.After all it's he who caused all the trouble in the first place.  'In and Out' isn't exactly dire.But when you consider the likes of Klines better work like 'A Fish called Wanda' you can't help but feel that here is a great talent being sadly wasted.

      "The Toxic Avenger  Part II starts with the startling revelation that after the Toxic Aveneger (John Altamura who was apparently fired during production & replaced with Ron Fazio) had rid his home town Tromaville of evil it actually became a nice place to live. This meant that Toxie had no use as a superhero anymore & now suffers from depression & a feeling of utter uselessness (just like directors Lloyd Kaufman & Michael Herz should feel like after producing this)  Toxie now works as a concierge at the 'Tromaville centre for the blind'. It's not long before trouble rears it's ugly head though  an evil chemical producing company called Apocalypse Inc. plans to take over Tromaville for some stupid insignificant reason or other but to do so they need to get rid of Toxie. After the evil chairman's (Rick Collins) first plan fails he bribes Toxie's psychiatrist (Erika Schickel) to tell him to go to Japan & see his Father. Leaving his girlfriend Claire (Phoebe Legere)  his Mother (Jessica Dublin) & his home behind Toxie heads for Tokyo  Japan. Once there Toxie sets about finding his Father & a woman named Masami (Mayako Katsuragi) helps him in his quest. Meanwhile back in Tromaville Apocalypse Inc. move in for the kill & without Toxie the citizens are powerless to defend themselves. Toxie eventually finds Big Mac Bunko (Rikiya Yasuoka) whom he has been lead to believe is his Father  however Big Mac is all part of Apocalypse Inc. plans to destroy Toxie once & for all...  Produced & directed by Lloyd Kaufman & Michael Herz this follow up to the successful The Toxic Avenger (1985) basically proves the first film was a complete fluke  a lucky accident to combine the right blend of bad taste comedy  outrageous violence & so-bad-it's-good film-making  The Toxic Avenger  Part II is a load of crap in comparison. The script by by Kaufman  Phil Rivio & Gay Partington Terry with a load of 'additional material' credits does not contain one single funny moment during it's entire 102 (uncut director's cut) duration. The visual gags are terrible  Toxie walking through Tokyo with a wig & glasses to blend in for instance  or a scene where he heats up a bath with a bad guy in it & as he cooks Toxie throws in a load of vegetable's & spaghetti  a scene where he sticks electrical wires up a woman's nose  sticks an antenna in her head & a microphone in her mouth to which a Japanese radio announcer talks into  a bit where a Japanese bad guy has his nose burnt into the shape of a fish  a bit where Toxie grabs a swordfish head & uses it as a weapon  or the embarrassingly bad overacting & stupid idiotic facial expressions  a guy who literary has a fish for a head & gets turned literary into sushi  the awful comedy music & sound effects & the whole film in general is a pale imitation of what made the original mildly amusing & memorable. The bad taste gags aren't there this time round & the silly childish juvenile humour of the first is also missing  it just feels like a real step back from the original & lets not forget this is Troma here so that is most definitely a bad thing. There are a few gory fights & some serious gore & violence  at least in the supposedly uncut 102 minute version I saw  crushed heads with the bodies spurting out blood  smashed faces  intestines  roses poked in someones eyes & thorns wrapped around their throat  ripped off ears  severed arms & a very graphic & gory scene of a man being chopped to pieces. Unfortunately the special effects by Pericles Lewnes aren't particularly convincing & come mostly within the first twenty or so minutes. The acting is of embarrassing proportions as I've already mentioned. Action wise there is an ultra cheap looking car chase at the end & a few unexciting  lacklustre fights utilising cardboard ninja throwing stars at one point. Horror wise there is nothing a few gory set pieces apart. Comedy wise this is very unfunny. In fact The Toxic Avenger  Part II sucks on all levels really & to top it all off it's atrociously made as well  most of the cast appear to be people plucked from the nearest street corner  continuity is none existent  cinematography is basic point & shoot & the special effects are anything but. One or two gory scenes apart this is total crap plain & simple  do yourself a favour watch the original again instead.\n",

      "Lord David Cecil wrote an interesting book in the 1930s EARLY VICTORIAN NOVELISTS  where he looked at the works of Dickens  Thackeray  Eliot  Trollope  Mrs. Gaskell  Charlotte Bronte  and Emily Bronte. He selected these writers as the popular favorites of the first half of the Victorian period  and he explained their strengths and weaknesses (as he saw them) to the reading public. Some of his comments are quite relevant to this day  but like all criticism it gives an idea of the spirit of the times of the critic's life as well.  Cecil thought highly of George Eliot (Mary Ann Cross)  who wrote about seven or eight books (including sketches and poetry). But for most modern readers  they are usually acquainted with her shortest book  SILAS MARNER  which is still read in some high school curriculum. The other books  FELIX HOLT THE RADICAL  DANIEL DERONDA  MIDDLEMARCH  THE MILL ON THE FLOSS  ADAM BEDE  ROMOLA  SCENES OF CLERICAL LIFE  are still in print (Penguin  for example  has most of them in print)  but are mostly unread. The one of most interest today is her last novel  DERONDA  where she discusses the Jews in English society  and an incipient  pre-Hertzl type of Zionism. ROMOLA is her sole attempt at a historic novel (about Savanarola's experiment of a religiously pure republic in Florence in the 1490s). Her meatiest novel is MIDDLEMARCH  which is concerned with English society in the provinces in 1832  the year of the great Reform Bill of Lord Grey. I had to read MIDDLEMARCH in college for a literature course. It certainly is a thoughtful book (Virginia Woolf called it the most grown-up book in the English language). But it suffers (like all of Eliot's novels) from one defect - she cannot write livable  exciting prose. While Dickens is overly exuberant at times  and Thackeray can become pompous and prolix  and Trollope can become (as Lord Cecil says) very ordinary in his discussion  and Charlotte Bronte can fail to explain certain relationships well  and Mrs. Gaskell seems best dealing with female characters  all of them (and Emily Bronte in her single novel) hold the reader's interest. Reading most of Eliot's novels is like trying to chisel sentences out of blocks of marble with a toothpick!  To date I have read about fifty pages of MILL OF THE FLOSS. I notice that one of the other reviewers never finished the novel too. But I have read a synopsis of what it is about. The Tullivers (Maggie and her brother Tom) are the central figures - they own the mill in the title. Although close at the start of the story  Maggie falls in love with the son of a neighbor whose father is involved in legal difficulties with Mr. Tulliver Sr. Tom takes a dim view of this relationship  and the tragedy of the story is regarding the split between the siblings  culminating in their demise at the conclusion (Maggie runs back to the mill to rescue Tom during a heavy flood  and they die together). It must have been a success with Victorian readers  but it is very gloomy and depressing to modern audiences.  The movie changed the ending a little - Maggie (Geraldine Fitzgerald) does die at the end with her lover  and Tom (James Mason) notes their deaths at the conclusion in his record book. The story is totally rewritten  except for a double death in the flood at the conclusion. It doesn't really help matters. Although Fitzgerald and Mason do pretty well with their parts  they can't really pull the film up by their work alone. The end result is a fairly minor film  that fortunately did not hurt the lead's careers. The only other thing to note is that the boyfriend was played by Frank Lawton  who two years earlier played David Copperfield as a grown up opposite W.C.Fields  Lionel Barrymore  and Maureen O'Sullivan. But then  Lawton never really had a major film career - he just happened to always be around in pictures  some good  some mediocre.\n",

      "Badland is one of the worst movies I ever seen. Most of the time this is fine and I can go on with my life  but I feel the need to warn others in this case. As a veteran of the Iraq war I feel it necessary to say that the story  plot  acting and depiction of what soldiers go through upon returning home was pure garbage. It was as if the director/writer/whoever latched on to whatever cliché about returning soldiers and ran with it and ran with it and ran with it..Not to mention I would imagine there was absolutely no research put into this film. The Marine uniform looked like it was fresh off a surplus store shelf and was a pattern not used since the first Iraq war. I won't go on forever  this is a horrible movie. If you are interested in the stories of returning soldiers there are much better alternatives. I recommend going to your local library.\n",

      "The Beautiful Country is a big disappointment. It doesn't come up to my expectation. Bihn  a tall muscular guy  is a son of an American GI and a Vietnamese woman during Vietnam War. We were told that that he was treated less than dust in Vietnam in the early 90s  so he fleeted to America to seek his American father.  Sounds like a heart broken material? Maybe  but showing in this film. I find myself having a hard time to connect to Bihn emotionally  because the film is full of cliché and I simply don't understand or believe him. The writing of this film is a total failure. The plot is full of holes. It grabs some events on a needed basis trying hard to stir the emotion of the audience. We are not that stupid and it doesn't work that way. Let's see what the film is trying to do. So  you don't feel Bihn's boat trip (yeah  he was on a boat!) is hard enough  let's have a storm over night and let the ship shake a little. Still not touched? Fine! Get a little kid to suffer the heat  the hungry  the sickness  the violence with the adults on the boat  hopefully that will do the trick to touch the audience. Still not touched? You heartless SOB  let's... OK  I don't want to give any spoiler of the film  but you get the idea.  The film is really long and slow. It never tell us why Bihn didn't go to find his mom and dad  until the moment in the film when he left to look for his mom and dad. What has he been doing the 20 some years before he went to Saigon to look for his mom? And guess what? He has the luck and everybody will tell him where to find the person he is looking for  and he will find anybody without a scratch. I really think the Department of Homeland Security should hire those Vietnamese who helped Bihn. The beautiful country? Which one? Both Vietnam and America seem hell to Bihn.\n",

      "Human Traffic is purely a `been there  done that' experience  only this time it's quite limp.  Major themes explored are paranoia  male impotence and jealousy  but only mildly and poorly.  A lot of the movie seems to want to imitate Trainspotting (drug / `clubbing' culture)  but it fails to include the low times / come-downs that Trainspotting deals with (eg: issues with death / dependence  etc). It even tries to come up with a similar monologue to Ewan McGreggor's classic `Choose Life' speech  but `The Milky Bars are on me! Yeah!'  what the fudge is that all about?!  The characters try to analyse their lifestyle but when their lifestyle is so shallow  their analysis becomes boring and repetitious.  The soundtrack (for a movie that is trying to be cool) is pathetic. It includes the likes of Fat Boy Slim and CJ Bolland  come on people  good dance music IS be better than this!  The characters become grating and annoying (especially half way through the movie) and the lack of care-for-the-characters soon dawns.  There are a couple of funny scenes  but they are few and far between. The mother catching the son in the bedroom was quite amusing.  But PLEASE  I'm sick to death of the Star Wars analogy scenes. I thought it was much more sharper in a couple of Kevin Smith's movies (ie: Clerks and Chasing Amy). According to the characters  Yoda is a drug fiend hence that's why he is short and bald  huh?!  My score  4 out of 10  do yourself a favour and see Trainspotting or Go instead!\n",

      "'You're in the Navy Now' is painfully bad: very likely the worst movie Gary Cooper ever made. It's supposedly based on a true story  but the incident which inspired this film doesn't seem to have enough plot to sustain a feature-length script.  I saw this movie on local television while I was house-sitting for my mother-in-law in Long Island  New York. There was a raging blizzard outside  and I was literally snowbound. If I'd been able to get out the door  I definitely would have stopped watching this movie.  There are some interesting names in the supporting cast  notably Charles Bronson (under his original name)  Lee Marvin  Harvey Lembeck  Jack Webb and Jack Warden. Forget it. Everybody stinks in this movie. Even the usually reliable Millard Mitchell is awful. Lee Marvin and Jack Warden are onscreen so briefly  there's no point in your watching for them.  Gary Cooper plays an obscure naval officer who is assigned to command a ship which is powered by a new  experimental steam turbine: basically  the whole ship is a giant teakettle. Cooper realises that the assignment is not a prestigious one: if it were  it would have gone to a better officer.  Cooper was a good actor in dramatic roles  but he simply had no ability for comedy. He made several bad comedies  and this one is his worst. Jane Greer has always bored me  and she bored me more than usual here. This ship went down with all hands  and sank without a trace. Have I mentioned that this movie stinks? I'll rate 'You're in the Navy Now' one point out of 10. Toot! Toot!\n",

      "The good news for IMDb is that this movie was so very bad that it compelled me to register and make a comment. I should add here that I'm a film buff who rarely passes harsh judgment. But sometimes a movie is so poorly acted  poorly conceived  poorly edited  with a such a poor story line that it begs criticism.  I'm surprised by all the claims of how superb  brilliant  dark  and beautifully shot this movie was. I can only conclude that the cast and crew are active posters here. The acting was extremely thin. The pace of the movie was agonizing. I gave it new chances at every turn (mostly because I didn't want to feel like I was wasting a Saturday morning in NY)  but with every new scene  it dragged longer  delivering characters in which I took no interest  with which I could not connect  for whom I could not empathize.  When I see negative reviews on IMDb of small independent films like this  I sometimes wonder if the poster has a personal axe to grind (something like. . he used to date the gaffer  she dumped him  and now he's going to trash everything she ever works on). But here  nope. I know no one who worked on this film. And I wish it would have been great. But the film wasn't dark (as some have mentioned) or depressing (as others have claimed). . . those suggest that I connected with the film . . . nope  Henry May Long was just too long  empty  and tedious.   That's the Tomas Take on this one.\n",

      "VIVA LA BAM This Jackass spin off focuses on the (obviously scripted) adventures of Bam Margera and his pals (Johnny Knoxville  Brandon Dicamillo  etc). This show  while it has its fair share of gross-out comedy and crazy stunts  focuses mainly on Bam's torturing of his parents.  I'm sorry to say this  Bam  but... you're in no way as cool as you think you are. This ego tripped show is not only painfully unfunny (and yes  I liked Jackass)  but also narcissistic beyond belief. The overly stylized intro ends with Bam coolly explaining that he's going to do whatever the f*** he wants to. How about you do something that is actually funny? I liked Jackass for what it was worth. The camera-work was horrible - any idiot could have made a better show with a camcorder in their parents' garage - but at least the show moved at a steady pace and never felt boring between the crazy  dangerous or simply disgusting stunts the pals performed.  Not so with Viva la Bam. We follow our hero around as he plays pranks on his friends and tortures his relatives  but never does it feel like anything else than really lame and scripted comedy. The stunts and pranks are mildly entertaining  but presented in such a tedious and dull fashion that they can barely make you smile.  Viva la Bam is a poor spin-off of that does little good but feed Margera's already too big ego. I don't recommend this lame and unimaginative show to anyone.\n",

      "I can envision the writers of this story thinking up this script:  1.Let's make a serial killer movie like Se7en  Knight Moves  Copycat  and Silence of the Lambs. People like serial killer stuff. It'll sell... 2.The killer needs to adopt some sort of pattern. I know; he'll copy it out of a serial killer mystery novel. That hasn't been done yet  at least not exactly like that. 3.Now  we need some kind of way to make this movie unique; of course  the good guy can be bedridden like in Rear Window. 4.Lastly  we need a twist ending that will give this movie the success of The Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects.  Okay  now that you know these things  you know the whole movie  so don't waste your money. One thing I really hate about moviemakers is that they take a perfectly good concept for movies and completely run them into the ground. I wrote better stories than this when I was in Junior High. I just kept checking my watch every five minutes. When the twist ending finally came  I wasn't shocked  I just said  Oh. Who cares?! The characters are two-dimensional. They have your typical movie personalities. This movie is just proof that stealing the elements of other successful movies is no excuse for a bad script. I give this movie 1 out of 10. Normally  it would earn at least 2 or 3  but I'm so sick of the unoriginality. When will they learn? 1/10\n",

      "I've become a big fan of the Carpenters  and I didn't really enjoy this movie.  I feel it focused far too much on her anorexia and didn't let her true personality shine through. I wasn't overly fond of Cynthia Gibb's portrayal; especially knowing she decided Karen's anorexia was suicide  which it clearly wasn't. Although her family was not big on hugs and kisses  I thought the movie portrayed Agnes (their mother) as being terrible.  I did find a few scenes to be harrowing in a way  such as where she sees herself in a mirror that seems to distort her and make her look heavier; I thought the metaphor (so-to-speak) there was rather effective. When the family is playing pool and discussing her divorce and she breaks down and Richard is shocked when he comforts her and feels her frail body was pretty moving (which is probably the wrong word) as well.  Overall  I feel they needed to bring out her more bubbly  quirky side--her genuine personality. Even as the focus of the film  there really wasn't a point that caused one to understand what would lead her to anorexia (though of course no one can really know)  and almost made it seem baseless. The film was more poor-singer-with-anorexia than Karen Carpenter's story  in my opinion.  I would assume that they changed her husband's name/profession and all because they couldn't get his permission to actually include him (there were some bad terms there)  but that whole aspect was inaccurate with the changes. On this note  I can't recall the movie bringing out her longing for a family and kids  which greatly prevailed in her life and explains her whirlwind romance and quick marriage to her husband.  On the whole  it ends up as a low-budget made-for-TV movie that just isn't very high quality and can be disappointing if you're a hardcore fan who is hoping to see beyond Karen's disease. I feel that such a legend deserves/deserved a better film as a tribute to an amazing person and an awesome voice.\n",

      "I'm a fan of Judy Garland  Vincente Minnelli  and Gene Kelly  but this movie just left me cold. I was expecting another American In Paris from Minnelli  so perhaps I was expecting too much.  The movie was short on songs and short of impressive dance numbers. I was impressed by the very expressionistic Kelly dance as Mococo on the ship. I was also impressed by the Nicholas Brothers in Be a Clown  too bad the song was so annoying. I also enjoyed Judy attacking Kelly with bric-a-brac. Check Lorna Luft's autobiography for some interesting information on that scene.  Actually  the movie has what must be some of Cole Porter's most annoying songs  especially Nina. Also  Judy and Gene yell constantly like screechy children.  The plot is thin--which is par for the course for musicals--but it is not saved by impressive dance numbers or by memorable songs. I suspect the best parts of this movie were left on the cutting room floor. Please  some movie restorer  find those bits of film and show us what the movie could have been!\n",

      "This film fails on every count. For a start it is pretentious  striving to be significant and failing miserably. The script was banal in the extreme  nobody at any time said anything remotely interesting. It was impossible to care about any of the characters. Knightly was a self-regarding waste of time whilst Sienna Miller was just a waste of time. The bit about the soldier who went off to war was a cliché even before the film Atonement used it. The use of the Second World War as a backdrop was in itself a cliché...the bombs  the sheltering in tube stations etc...employed to import a bit of much-needed drama. Why anybody thought for a moment that this film was worth making is quite beyond my comprehension.

After around 2 minutes I had an expression on my face which fitted the term boooooooooooooring! quite perfectly. 7.5 minutes of not even bouncing concrete like tits (at this point the term breasts is a bad choice) is far beyond from entertainment.

Well - I wasted my money. But not all was bad in this movie. THey at least got the gore right  as well as some of the most unique methods of murder seen in a long time. There is even a storyline (kinda) and that is about it.  But for an exploitation film there is a surprising amount of content - but no exploiting. We get gay sex - sorta. We have 3 inter-racial babes - maybe. We have a psychotic Vietnamese hooker - nice back  oral sex (ok that made me wince) and some female version of Gene Simmons (I don't get that part). We have an honest to goodness Capone - rates among the best of the actors in this film - that is not a compliment. And finally we have a government conspiracy thrown in to - I don't know - try to connect the vengeance/random/theme killing by Jimmy boy to make the Vietnamese psycho seem sane???????

      "The unthinkable has happened. Having first witnessed it a few years ago  I have had a film that has been my benchmark for awfulness and that film was called McCinsey's Island. A family adventure movie with Hulk Hogan and Grace Jones (I'm not making this up)  it plunged to new depths of movie making and is still the only film I've seen that made me wonder what else the film's budget could have been spent on. Like new schools or cancer-treating drugs. However  for sheer and unadulterated levels of crap  any film will be having to lower their standards even lower if they wish to trump Guest House Paradiso to the distinction of being one of the very worst movies I've ever had to watch.  Based loosely around the puerile but amusing TV show Bottom  this film introduces us to two of the biggest losers imaginable. Richard (Rik Mayall) is a hotel manager  as unfriendly as anyone you can imagine and so twistedly lecherous as to almost ooze slime from every action. His buddy Eddie (director Adrian Edmondson) is an alcoholic waste of human life and together  they try to run Britain's worst hotel situated upon a cliff-top next to a nuclear power station. Between them  they indulge in cartoony violence (with sound effects) at regular intervals  steal anything remotely valuable or interesting from the fools who stay there and stare longingly at any woman at all. The plot  such as it is  involves the arrival of fabled Italian screen goddess Gina Carbonara (Vincent Cassel) who is fleeing from her wedding and attempts to lay low at the Guest House Paradiso  much to the astonishment of Richie and Eddie. And... that's it.  I used to think that the Carry On films represented everything bad about the UK film industry and God knows  we've spent so much time and money trying to escape that god awful legacy. We've had films like Trainspotting  28 Days Later  Four Weddings And A Funeral and the brilliant Shaun Of The Dead (also starring Simon Pegg) but this... this drags those films screaming and kicking back to the days of Sid James and Barbara Windsor's top flying off with the aid of a bicycle whistle. Guest House Paradiso is so low in its ambition that it insults you the minute you watch it. I kept watching  waiting in anticipation for the jokes to start but they never came. Just an endless stream of trapped knob gags  unimaginative scenarios that defy explanation  slightly amusing violence with frying pans and fridge doors and almost nothing raising so much as a smirk. Come the first ad break (it was on TV  you see) and I was ready to switch off but my loyal duties to you  my readers  kept me going. I'm watching this so they don't have to became my mantra so you guys better remember how much you owe me for this because this was about as much fun as having sand kicking into my eyes and being force-fed dog food.  Trust me  I used to love the Bottom TV show. The combination of suitably grubby acting from Mayall and Edmondson with OTT juvenile humour worked... for half an hour every week. Certainly not for an hour and a half  as Edmondson and Mayall indulge themselves in their little private joke and bore and depress the rest of the audience. Honestly  this makes Mayall's Drop Dead Fred seem like The Godfather and should you happen to meet either of these two people (who are pretty much solely responsible for the chaos on screen pretending to be a movie)  feel free to swiftly deliver a boot to their testicle region. They'd probably enjoy it. Pegg and Bill Nighy (both as guests at the hotel) are dragged down with this sinking ship but at least they survived. Mayall and Edmondson should not be so lucky. The movie equivalent of Chernobyl and should be avoided as such.\n",

      "Now that's it's 2008  who really has a care in the world about a guy like DB Sweeney  even back then he wasn't a big deal.  Two Tickets to Paradise is an outlined story that's well and true where three friends hit the road under each of their personal circumstances. Again  a proved plot. The problem with this film  other than it's 'so bad it's compelling' title  is the script.  Cliché after cliché three guys do the same things you've seen in every other road movie... and blow up vanna white's house.  John C. McGinley's acting job is superb  especially compared to that of the late DB Sweeney's. (His career is dead  hence the late. though i hear he's moving to TV  good for him). Also  John C likely has the least awful character in the film.  The score is so generic it actually feels like you're watching a third rate film from 1993  or Jeff Anderson's movie Now You Know (also set me back a few years  but at least that was more entertaining.) I mean  yah  i guess i enjoyed parts of it. But  the nerdy guy is annoying  DB tries to be this cool failed guitar player (with some rough influences  like some of the worst of classic rock) who has some strange relationship with a stripper  and John C is a gambler who's wife and kid leave him after the death of his father as well as a visit from one of his bookie's henchmen.  I keep thinking up ways to make this movie better. But i think burning the script would have been a healthy start.  But  as i've hinted this whole time  it's not the worst movie ever. And any chance i have to see McGinley in a starring role  i'll take it. Hopefully he starts getting some better projects.\n",

I do NOT like The Ice Pirates  though.   For one  it just looks too cheap  you know? For a movie that's supposed to take place in outer space  it feels cramped and closed-in like it's being filmed in the front seat of someone's Mazda. And the special effects  while appropriately cheesy  look more than anything like foam rubber painted metallic gray.  Usually  I don't let things like that bother me  especially if the story and the characters are worthwhile.  They ain't.  The whole storyline  about these ne'er-do-well space pirates who decide to find a planet loaded with ice they can melt down and sell as water (a hot commodity in the future  I guess) is about as original as the jokes  which is not a compliment.  The humor comes in at about crotch-level (like that castrating machine you'll see early on)  and everyone seems to have a cranky attitude. And who told John Matuzak that he was funny? Whoever did  shame on them. Good old Robert Urich tries  but he's a reliable actor on board a badly sinking ship (or starship  in this case).   I watched this one about three times and ended up feeling the same way every time - shanghaied.  No stars. In spite of of the presence of Huston (one year prior to Prizzi's Honor) and Carradine (at the tail end of a once-lofty career)  these Pirates should walk the plank.\n",

      "This film is terrible  and don't blame Jesus Franco  because its not his fault.  This film was shot silent over many years by Welles as he got the money to bring a crew and the actors together to do some shooting. How much film Welles actually shot is not clear  although not all of the film or all of the sequences are here since several key sequences  such as Quixote in a movie theater  are in the hands of collectors or backers who wouldn't give them up. The film here is just under two hours and I would be hard pressed to imagine it ever really working at any length. I'm of the opinion  based on several comments that Welles made before his death  that he never really intended to release the film  but was putting it together as a personal toy.  What exists here is for the most part is beautifully shot  but dramatically dead. Very little happens for the first hour other than Quixote and Sancho wandering around the country side. Dull would be a kind description of the material. In the second hour Quixote ends up in modern Spain and in a series of not very good sequences deals with everyday life. This isn't to say that there isn't a few nice moments  the windmill and the chicken sequences are quite good  but mostly this is a vast waste of film and time.  Completed by Jesus Franco  who was Welles' assistant director on the vastly superior Chimes at Midnight  we have a bunch of film fragments that have been put together as best as possible. Many people have crucified Franco as having been the reason the film stinks  but frankly one can not make a good movie from crap material. One critic has gone on record as having seen a different cut of the film in the 1970's  which meant that Franco made this version up on his own and ruined it. While that maybe true  I've run across stories of Welles cutting and re-cutting the film many many times over the years since he could never get it right.  This film is terrible no matter how you slice it.  Ultimately I'm left wondering just how good a film maker Welles was. Aside from Citizen Kane almost all of his films have been plagued by lack of budget or interfered with so we are left with the excuse that many of his films would have been better if only.... How do we know? How can we know? Perhaps Welles was a man of less talent than we thought and many of his borderline films just aren't that good  and never would have been. While this is no place to argue the place of Welles in film history  the surviving material of Don Quixote  assuming it approximates what Welles intended (I think it does)  is a good case for rethinking how we view the man and his work.  4 out of 10 for the good sequences (though 2 out of 10 is probably closer to reality)\n",

The only one who did and was believable was the veteran and he probably committed suicide just to get out of the movie as soon as he could. It was a waste of talent  film  their time  and mine. If there is a message or meaning or genius in this story  it certainly is well-hidden or I am very dense  which I doubt.\n",

      "This very loose retelling of Carmen begins on a high note with a smoldering  sexually-frank dance between Senaglese prisoner Karmen and her female prison warden  but the vibrant opening minutes never ignite into any coherent film. One minute Karmen is all sexual predator  the next she is dancing in protest to her unfair government  and then suddenly she is a smuggler on the high seas... Although the film deserves kudos for postulating the first carnivorously bisexual Karmen  the broad strokes it paints are so vignette-like and unsupported by any narrative coherence that the film comes off as a schizophrenic  undisciplined melange of Basic-Instinct meets Bound meets an African version of a Bollywood musical.\n",

As for this documentary  it's entertaining; entertaining and blatantly misleading! Most of the historical looking footage is most likely just that  historical footage from completely unrelated events that were sadly cut and pasted into this documentary to make it more dramatic than it would have ever been otherwise. There's no doubt that Waverly is a pretty interesting place with plenty of it's own fascinating history  but manufacturing a documentary to market the locale and the related production is  for lack of better words  appallingly useless.

Then  with that beautiful cast recording fresh in mind  watch the movie  with Streisand as Streisand  and Yves Montand reading his lines with such a heavy French accent that a chain saw couldn't cut through it. The best part (for those who need something to look forward to) is what Montand does to the introductory part of the title song. Listen as he sings/says: Could anyone among us have an inkling or a clue  what magic feats of wizardry and voodoo you can do? (That one part sums up the problem that results from casting name stars in movie musicals instead of the appropriate talent for the various roles.) I can just see Rex Harrison entering that scene and suggesting Montand  too  could learn to do justice to the beauty of the English language.  \n",

      "I like Errol Flynn; I like biographies and I like action movies. This featured all three of these....but I didn't like this film. It just went on too long although the last 20 minutes was excellent  especially in the photography with some great low- angle shots. However  I seemed like it took six hour to get to that point  and I really can't say why I feel this way.   The action is interesting  Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland are fine. In fact  it was refreshing to see de Havilland actually be supportive of Flynn instead of her normal role as antagonist to him. Yet something is lacking in this movie.  The film has been roundly criticized for its historical inaccuracy but I don't hear that same criticism for a lot of other films which have done the same. In fact  its RARE when a film is historically accurate. For some reason  this revisionist history offended most critics. If the film had made General Custer a lot worse than he really was  they would have probably liked it. Well  too bad. In their twisted way  critics prefer villains to heroes.   I really wish I could have enjoyed this more but I'll take a lot of other Flynn adventures over this one.\n",

I also liked the characters and could have grown to empathise with them. The film had a good atmosphere and there was a hint of fantasy.  However  as the film went on  the plot never appeared to takeoff and just rolled on scene by scene. I was unable to understand the connection between the stories. All I could see was the characters occasionally bumping into each other and references to ships in bottles. Without that connection  I was just left with a few unremarkable short stories.

      "Max Cash a charter boat captain who works off the Caribbean island San Sebastian is hired by Sarah  who's looking for legendary boat  El Diablo and its stolen treasure that sunk out in the reef in the 17th century. But something seems to be protecting the whereabouts of the ship  as people who knew anything about it are being killed.  I have to agree with those that were under the impression that this was going to be a horror feature. Instead what we ended up with was a low-rent  b-grade late 80s take on 1977 deep-sea adventure film 'The Deep'  but with a baffling supernatural origin and an injection of mystery. The story is a tame muddle (so many inconsistent angles don't make a lick of sense and encourages a blotchy pace) and the technical side is clunky. Nice exotic location and under-water photography though. While the carefree performances weren't too bad either. A gruff Wayne Crawford is enjoyably witty and June Chadwick is fair along side him. Sheri Able is pretty much eye candy. There are some bizarre developments that amuse and one or two eerie sequences. However there's a real lack of cohesion. Most of the cutaway deaths happen off-screen  except for the bloody  fitful opening kills done by something unseen. Again just another thing that leaves you high and dry. The music is generic with its thumping cues to warn us of approaching danger and the POV shots get a good working out. Tatty  but watchable.\n",

      "I'd never thought that I would be caught saying this: But I think Dog the Bounty Hunter is more entertaining than this 90's era cop drama. Walker is very melodramatic and actually set a standard of the genre of High Octane cop shows such as CSI  CSI: Miami  and so forth. I'm not saying all these shows are bad  but they aren't good either. I like the karate chop action that Walker dispenses on the enemies of justice  and the diverse cast of characters as much as the science tech of the CSI series. But there are some elements that I hate in a show like this. Stereotypes/Countertypes! That's right  Stereotypes/Countertypes! Unfortunately  this is a show for the moderates of Red State America who refuse to part with the old prejudices of yore especially when it comes to crime. For example  there was an episode in which a kid with psychic powers ventures into Dallas where he encounters group of kids in Goth/Punk clothing and they start harassing him. Now! This is exactly what Middle America perceives the Goth/Punk culture. I mean come on  how often do people that dress like that rob and steal from people just minding there own business. Whenever there are Blacks and Latinos in the plot it's always about gangs in some impoverished neighborhood. Okay! Not everyone who's a minority is a desperate recruit of a gang surrounded by crime  drugs  poverty. Again  this is what Middle Red State America sees of these people.

      "Love Life explores a very culturally relevant scenario of a marriage of convenience between a lesbian and a gay man. I found the subject matter compelling  even if the conflict was a bit forced and too easily resolved. For example  Thomas falls for Joe a little too quickly and conveniently for the plot. There are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage  Joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene. In the end  I found myself more turned-on by this movie than moved. Stephan D. Gill has a pretty nice body and shows it all quite a few times with pornstar skill and exuberance  and all-too-often acting chops to match. Many times  the movie seems like it is going to go full-on porn.

      "The title tells it all -- Ed Gein  the butcher of Plainfield.  It's not a zappy action-filled slasher movie made for teens high on energy drinks. That would fit it into a well-established genre  the kind that some people find entertaining  something along the lines of Halloween or The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.  This is dark  slow  filled with chopped-up corpses  and quietly evil. There are few shock cuts  no monster's point-of-view shots  no loud electronic score. I don't know who it's aimed at -- ghouls  maybe.  Beneath the credits we already see still photos of skulls  carcasses hung up  skins draped across the backs of chairs  that sort of thing. And they're sufficiently revolting that I couldn't help thinking this movie had better be pretty good to make up for this Grand Guignol opening.  Alas  it's not. The acting is uniformly terrible  as in a high school play. The script does its best to sink below vulgarity. Ed Gein  who killed only two middle-aged women and maybe his brother  chases a screaming  bloody young woman through the Woodland of Weir  and she's wearing only a modern bra and bikini  rather than period underwear. Gein also decapitates a night watchman  which he never did in any historical sense.  The direction? You could do a better job. In the first few minutes  law officers discover an abandoned car with blood spattered all over the windshield. There is no body. The handsome young deputy sheriff turns to his boss and suggests they search for the victim  who may still be in the vicinity and living. The sheriff  lacking any motivation  shouts at him  Now you just FORGET that! I don't want you going off HALF COCKED on anything! It should be no more than a business-like exchange of views. Why does the director have the sheriff so angry? Characters of diverse sorts listen to radio programs or records that play old jazzy pop songs -- Louis Armstrong's Ain't Misbehaving  for instance. This is -- what -- rural WISCONSIN in the 1950s? And the characters insist on music that would appeal to customers of the Cotton Club in Harlem in the 30s  or New York intellectuals like Woody Allen. Nope. The radio would be playing Kitty Kallen's Wheel of Fortune or Theresa Brewer or  equally likely  Lefty Frizell. Not that the dysfunction between the music and the events adds anything to our understanding of what's going on beneath the images. Someone involved in the production just liked old jazzy pop songs  that's all.  Of course there's only so much you can do with a low budget  but it can be light years ahead of this butchery. See Ed Gein  with Steven Railsback for an example of a much more sophisticated way of dealing with this lunatic and his penchant for dead bodies  and on a budget that couldn't have exceeded this one by much.  These comments are all based on the first twenty minutes of the movie. That's about as far as I could get. If anyone finds this tale to be well-executed and fascinating in any way  he should try to find some insight into his tastes. It's beneath mine -- and I consider myself pretty warped.\n",

Talk Radio is about talk-back host 'Barry Champlain'  a very loud  opinionated man who manages to upset a lot of people and yet still draw an audience  most of whom mind you just want to ring up and abuse him.

      "THE GOOD: The acting were great especially Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton. Terrence Howard should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor instead of Matt Dillon.  THE BAD: I'm a visible minority (non-white) and I have experienced some form of racism in my life. BUT despite my life experiences and the movie's subject matter  I would definitely NOT say that this movie is the best of the year  in fact  it's FAR from it. I have problems with this movie both from a moviegoer's perspective and from a visible minority's perspective. Some of my problems with this movie are:  (1) Poor character development (or none at all). Just because we saw extremes in a character  for example  Matt Dillon being a racist cop and being a good caregiver to his ailing father  that does not mean in any way that the character is well-developed. Yes  I admit that in a big cast ensemble like in this movie  it is quite difficult for every character to be well-developed  BUT that does not mean that at none of the characters should be like that.  (2) The dialogue seems really contrived to the point that I'm really surprised this movie won for Best Original Screenplay. They should show this movie in a screenplay writing class NOT because it's good but to show students and future screenplay writers what NOT to do. I just felt like I've been hit by the head over and over again how bad racism is. I get it.  (3) The plot seems so coincidental  it is laughable. What are the chances of a black car robber running over an Asian guy who also happens to be a human trafficker while entering his van  and that same black car robber ended up carjacking that Asian guy's van several hours later after he brought him the hospital  only to find out that the several Asians being trafficked inside the van just to show you that the black car robber has a good side after all? Or  what about that scene where a prejudiced upper-class white woman who fell down the stairs and all her prejudice and hatred vanished into thin air? If it was THAT simple  why don't we throw every racist in America down the stairs so they will have a change of heart?  (4) I think my biggest misgivings about this movie is the unrealistic view of racism. As someone who has experienced racism in my life  the realistic view of racism is that it is hidden rather than in your face. I've been refused to enter a supermarket because I'm not white. Did the store owner said because I was not white? No  he said the store was closing even though there were a lot of people shopping inside. Did he yell racial slurs? No. Racism in America is more hidden. Some cab drivers probably won't stop to pick you up because you're non-white but that does not mean that they will try to run you over or get out and say racial slurs. If a Chinese woman rear-ended me  I won't be saying blake! blake! Learn some English bitch!. On the other hand  if I was a Chinese woman and I accidentally rear-ended a Mexican woman  I won't say Mexicans are bad drivers in front of her face. That's not how things work. Instead  I would give out my insurance info  say sorry  and go home and tell my fellow Chinese friends and family that Mexicans are poor drivers and make fun of them behind their backs. That is the real racism. It's hidden and not in your face.  Anyway  Crash is not original unlike what some people may say. The interlocking and interweaving story lines  plots  and characters have been done before. Magnolia is a movie that does this much better than Crash did and yet  it was never nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. It had a stellar cast -- Julianne Moore  William H. Macy  Phillip Seymour Hoffman (who won best Actor recently)  Tom Cruise  etc. It really boggles my mind how Crash was even nominated for Best Picture.\n",

      "This is a film that has garnered any interest or praise it has received simply on the merit of being a lesbian interest piece. The performances are mostly emotionless compared to better films in the GLBT interest genre. The entirety of the film's watchable value is garnered through modest suspense over whether and when the partners' family members will say something discouraging about their lesbian relationship. The best element of the film is likely the beautiful New England scenery  although much of the film is set inside. It is hard to envision how any viewer watching this film and not seeking affirmation of their GLBT lifestyle or wishing to see that of others affirmed  even through poorly realized drama  could appreciate Treading Water in any significant way.

      "What should have been a routine babysitting gig at a secluded lake house turns into a night of terror  as high school student Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) receives threatening phone calls from a sadistic stalker  while trying to stay one step ahead of him.  The first 20 minutes of the original film were pretty good but it was all downhill from there. The remake takes those first 20 minutes and stretches them into an 80 minute feature film. That's a good idea because its eliminating everything that made the original bad. However  if they wanted this film to work more effectively then they should have hired a better lead actress  better director  writer etc. There's no suspense  everything can be figured out long before it happens and it's a very dull film since not much happens. At least there isn't much to sit through since its less than 90 minutes.  If this premise were to work  then the lead actress has to give a realistic performance. Camilla Belle gives one of the worst performances I have ever seen and throughout the whole movie  she seemed to be reading her lines. You get a lead role in a Hollywood film that will be viewed by millions of people and you give no effort at all! Why did they hire this girl? Sure  she's pretty but she can't act at all yet I suppose this won't matter to the target audience who will most likely eat this film up. The rest of the cast is bland and forgettable especially the woman who plays the maid  Rosa. Even the stranger was lame and his lines on the phone were not effective at all.  This movie reminds me of last years disappointing horror film Boogeyman. That movie was a bunch of cheap scares and false alarms and When a Stranger Calls is pretty much the same. Jill enters a room because she hears a noise but its just a false alarm like a cat or the maid. This type of scene happens over and over again until finally after about 50 minutes  the stranger appears. He has to be one of the lamest killers ever. He carried no weapons and didn't seem to pose much of a threat. The ending is bad but it matches the rest of the film so it doesn't really matter. The film is directed by Simon West and he is really bad at building up suspense. He was using every cliché he could think of and the results weren't very good. The house was amazing and I'll give the film credit for that. It was an isolated house so it was pretty creepy but that's about the only good thing this film has to offer. In the end  if you're not a teenage girl then you should skip the movie. Rating 2/10\n",

      "Weird with unnecessary singing and backdrops. Randomly much of the action will occur on stage giving the feeling of an opera performance. None of that explains why this is such a bad film.  It's the impression that either not enough rehearsal took place or that no experienced choreographer was available. The acting is flat. Even the sparkling Ziyi Zhang looks like she's just waiting for her next movement or line. You may notice the trivia on this site stating that she spent half a month in Japan learning to sign and dance. Read that again as 2 weeks and things begin to make sense. Even worse are the little kids who seem to be looking at their parents at the back of the studio rather than at the camera.  The cheap and cheerful sfx are just cheap and cheap. The editing is staccato chops peppered with slices of just nothing that adds to anything except annoyance. Just imagine all the silly dance scenes from the recent Zatoichi - particularly the closing routine - performed by your local high school drama club with one famous actress who speaks in another language (but you get her in simply because she's so good normally despite being unsuitable)  recorded on a cheap camera and then edited into three times its length in no artful order.\n",

      "Ha ha. - oh no - what to say about this film? Yes - green eggs and ham makes more sense than this movie. Where does one start? A lot of the good stuff has already been said - so I won't divulge into the same territory. I believe you already have the movie summary - so I won't paraphrase the movie.  First - let's start the with good.  1). If you like psychological thrillers that make you think (as I do) the first 29 minutes of this film will be for you - this is one of those films that illustrates the question that you always talked about on long car drives when you were kids like (what if you had to chose one family member live  another to die  or  what if you had to die by drowning or fire) This movie is a great concept - bottom line.  2) The wardrobe group did a fine job with bringing us back to the 70's. Realistically though  how difficult is that to accomplish? .....Okay  that's about all for the good. Let's talk about the bad.  1). This movie feels like a 2 hour Twilight Zone episode. This could easily be 90 minutes. That might have made the movie tolerable.  2). Do you remember in the movie From Dusk til Dawn?. The movie started out interesting  then halfway through the movie it just took a degrading turn? Yep - same thing here. I would venture to say that the writers started with a concept  then had no idea what to do with it. I've gotten deeper thought provocation out of Transformers 2.  3). Yes - we get the dilemma in the film. We understand the philosophical undertones and Utilitarian approach - but the story jumped around way too much  didn't elaborate on the current story arc  and took a(forgive me)completely insulting direction.  4). The ending didn't make sense. Not at all. None.  This movie would make a great term paper in college philosophy 101. If you're board out of your mind  in bed sick  or have ever enjoyed being hit in the face with a pie  and can view this free on-line - by all means  go for it.  If you need to pay anything to view this movie  don't waste your time - you're better off watching old Howie Mandel stand-up on You Tube. You will get more philosophical stimulation reorganizing your sock drawer.\n",

      "I deliberately did not read any reviews of this movie on IMDb before I watched it because I really wanted to see it and make up my own mind. I have been a big fan of QT in the past  I think we can all agree he has made some great movies  but lately he seems to have been overcome by his own mystique and disappeared up his own fundament. This movie proves that. It consists of few scenes of the Basterds at work. It consists instead mostly of long  tedious  boring stretches of conversation between people that  after a while  you realise you just do not give a stuff about. It's longwinded and lacks any of the great sparkling dialogue that QT has been responsible for in the past. The entire movie is anticlimactic. There is no tension - what is going to happen in every scene is telegraphed so clearly in advance that by the time it happens you just don't care. Honestly folks  don't believe the hype. This is a very boring movie and you will be missing nothing if you don't see it.\n",

      "We sought out this hard-to-find VHS after watching two excellent Merchant-Ivory pictures back to back. Knowing it was an instant box office failure  a failure as a rental  I thought it might be worth seeing anyway based on M-I's reputation. Too bad! Nine years ago  it was very much a Liberal Agenda objective to trash the Founding Fathers and indeed they had some success in eradicating the Founding Fathers from many American classrooms including  for example  New Jersey; whose eradication of our great founders quickly ended when the Washington Times shone the spotlight of truth into the NJ School Board and their subversive deed. A small part of this was headlining the alleged Sally Hemmings-Thomas Jefferson connection  disregarding the inconvenient DNA findings which failed to support the wacky left's agenda. Never mind! They got James Ellis  an author of dubious reputation  to put it in a book  and Columbia University sealed the deal by giving Ellis a Pulitzer.  As to Jefferson in Paris  the Liberal Agenda spin begins in the opening scene wherein James Earl Jones is claiming to be the son of Jefferson. The spin simply continues in flashback mode to Paris. The unmistakable truth is that even if a person assumes the lie is true the Hemmings allegation would be an insignificant detail into the larger matter of Jefferson's prolonged and vital diplomatic mission to Paris (as well as to the Netherlands where he secured crucial financial backing for America when our infant nation was without funds).  Besides the Liberal Spin Job  there is nothing else of interest in this drab and tortuously dull movie. Some of the other history is indeed accurate --- adding credence to frame the lie --- but this movie takes one of the most interesting moments in American history and reduces it to a remedy for insomnia.  Please do not ask me why Liberals set out to trash the Founding Fathers  because I don't waste time explaining the acts of such people. Don't ask them either; they usually respond to such questions with the same answer: SHUT UP!\n",

As an historical epic  it could have had so many more chances to be a rich saga... but it's really no more than just another cheap '70s action flick with a based-on-real-events story and an eyepatch-sporting Sonny Chiba. Before this movie's halfway point  I was even tempted to commit seppuku! The music is like a thousand dogs in heat wailing in your ears to a tune composed by Ennio Morricone (that's not an insult towards Morricone).

Having seen  loved  admired and respected Se Souvenir des belles choses which explores memory loss - albeit as the result of Alzheimer's - in a profound and heartbreaking way  not least in the luminous performance of Isabelle Carre I find that Novo is an insult to Se Souvenirs. I have no problem with soft porn per se - and even if I had I'd virtually have to give up going to movies so prevalent is it today - but I do have a problem with writers/directors who attempt to respectablise it by cloaking it as here in the guise of medical research.

      "Okay wait let me get this street  there are actually some morons on this site who reckon this is one of the better if not the best Halloween sequel. I even read someone saying it was just as good as the original. Pah what nonsense don't believe them I've watched every Halloween and clearly unlike some people knows what makes at the very least a good horror movie and this shower of S is one of the Worst horror movies i have ever seen in my life. Frankly if i was John Carpenter i would sue the person who wrote this either that or go around to his or her place with a hunting rifle. Seriously Halloween sequels in general are nearly all rubbish  two was crap  three was stupid  four is alright  five is well five  H20 alright  Resurrection painful. Yet  in many ways i find this to be the worst of a very bad bunch of sequels. Why? Well let me just embark on some kind of rant not so much a review but a mindless rant on why Halloween 6 the Cure of Michael Myers is one of the most abysmal movies i have seen in a very long time. OK where should i start  ah yes the plot oh boy the plot. Basically the plot is a heaped together mess containing cults  signs of Thor and some other crap. It's just stupid it really is  the film tries to be flashy and intelligent yet  its heaped together in such a horribly made way. Why does Michael Myers got to have a reason for killing people? Simple enough explanation Micahel likes to kill his relatives that would suffice  but no we have to have a man in black and mysterious cults and signs of Thor and utter crap. God its so bad it made me want to cry it really did  the writers have tried to add to the character of Myers but have actually managed to do the entire opposite. Apart from wearing a mask and a boiler suit < which is a completely different colour by the way  Myers just isn't the same guy from the original or even two  heck maybe even four. Thats another thing why has Myers become a Jason Voorhes parody? I thought it was meant to be the other way round  yet Myers is so similar to Jason  all he does is endlessly kill people in gory ways. In the original he teased his victims took his time and as a result the whole thing was far more suspenseful. In this he just walks around hacking people to death. I mean in the space of Half an Hour we had equalled the amount of kills in the original it was just ridiculous. Oh and Myers in this seems to have a really big head  i mean its huge and hes put on loads of weight. What else is crap  oh yeah the return of Tommy Jarvis thats pretty bad  in fact all the characters in this film are crap bar Dr Loomis of course. I can't stand the little kid  i wish he had got it he's really irritating. Our Heroin is boring and not interesting. And her whole family are a terrible bunch of actors. The mother is rubbish  the brother is bad and the Father i mean was this his first part or something? He was like a cartoon villain for gods sake he was actually more evil than Myers < By the way his death is one of the most abysmal i've ever seen i think even Friday the 13th wouldn't come up with something so entirely laughable. What else is rubbish oh yeah Tommy Jarvis  don't know the name of the guy but he really can't act  he tries his best to be serious and all that but i just wanted to laugh at him. I wish he had died in fact if everyone had died it would have been quite good really. There is Dr Loomis a horribly aged and dieing Donald Pleasence by all account. Despite him being on his last legs Pleasance is still the stand out in the brief amount of time he features. Its such a pity that such a corner stone of this franchise had to say farewell in garbage like this. What else is rubbish  oh yeah the bit where the radio DJ gets it. Firstly how the hell did Michael manage to get in that van when five minutes ago he was in his house? Secondly it was just a pointless kill which may boost the body count but is just another peace of nonsense which adds to the drivel that is this film. Its in fact that death which said it all for me in that it was pointless a lot like this film.\n",

      "Man  the '90's really were an horrible decade for movies. The movies are lacking in a good style and also the storytelling is often lacking.  This 6th entry into the long running Halloween-series is certainly a bad one. You just never really get into the story because it isn't a very well constructed and build-up movie.  It's simply a poorly done film  that also suffers from its imagine-less writing and non-compelling characters that are in it. Dr. Loomis seems to be in it just for the sake of being in it. It's a real shame that this had to be Donald Pleasence last film-role. It's nice and also sort of suiting that his last role is in an Halloween movie but he definitely deserved to be in a better one.  There is never a sense of real danger in the movie and the character of Michael Myers just never comes across as threatening or scary. Perhaps it's because he's featured too prominently throughout the movie  from pretty early on already. He does his usual stuff again but without too much class or originality. Also the attempts to uncover Myer's past don't really work out  for the main reason that it just doesn't get explained very well. It's obvious that the script went through various re-writes before- and also very possibly during filming. Several scenes even got re-shot or added after the first cut turned out to be far from pleasing.   The movie more often looks and feels like a made for TV one. This is also due to the lack of some real good gore. As an horror movie it really is lacking in basically everything to make this a good or even original one to watch.  So far the worst out of the series!  3/10\n",

Comments: I've seen the Redux version released in 2008 of the original that was released in 1994. How the two versions differ I can't say  but the Redux is very heavily stylized in the way of Chinese Wuxia action. That is unfortunate as that style to me seems to have forgotten one of the most important elements of a successful and entertaining movie. A comprehensible story. But true to its style scenery and visual elements seem much more important and much more in focus of writer and director Kar Wai Wong. Therefore there are lots of colorful  very beautiful scenes  that are completely unrelated to the story.  The editing and timeline of the story is also mishandled. Much is left out in the scenes  the time line is broken and rearranged in a confusing way. Very slow and calm scenes are suddenly relieved by surprisingly brutal and seemingly unmotivated fights  only to themselves being relieved by something else and unrelated. The result is a confusing and very uninteresting movie.  Thanks to these brutal but very few fights  the movie is put into the action genre. The poster and photographs also imply this but could almost be regarded as false marketing. Only a few minutes out of the 90 could be considered as anything like action  the other couldn't be farther away from it. The movie in its entirety is very slow  dull and hence very boring. Not even the rare action filled scenes help since they are so disconnected from the rest of the movie.  I might say that I'm not a fan of this Chinese style  since they often seem to be afflicted of these same problems  most importantly that the visual is more important than the story  but Ashes of Time Redux is perhaps the worst example I've seen.  3/10\n",

The make-up effects are okay  the gore is VERY minimal (PG rating)  and the extremely irritating characters are focused on way to much  which really got on my nerves. I guess having group of terrible actors bickering for an hour was suppose to equal some comedic status  yet I found no humor in it  whatsoever. The entire concept is just ridiculous - how these kids are willing to dig up and monkey around with a dead body for as long as they did. The characters are stereotypical and bland and the movie is just plain boring... Don't waste your time with it...\n",

      "I wasted 5 dollars renting this complete piece of crap. Dr. Zack is the most unlovable lead character i have ever seen. The movie was full of EVERY cliche you could ever think of and contained not a single OUNCE of originality. There was the typical sexism portrayed by rugged foreigners  all the guys had those 'too-proud to take advice' attitudes that are as stale as grandma's christmas fruitcake. The concept and deaths were really cool  but they lose all novelty once the monster is revealed. (read the SPOILER at the end) Nothing else is really revealed though  the ending is the biggest cop-out you've ever seen. I predicted everything before it happened  including who would die and how. The dialogue is lacking  and that's an understatement by far. There's mostly just random yelling  thoughtful staring  and chunky sentences. The actors are just GOD AWFUL! I don't want to talk about this movie anymore  it's making me angry. I just wonder if the director even watched it when it was done.  (SPOILER ALERT!!!! SAVE 5 DOLLARS!) the monster is just a bunch of ants that evolved so now they need bones so they can move around  (nevermind the fact that this serves no evolutionary advantage whatsoever  and that the ants just killed whoever was available  though the movie acts like they kill out of necessity. This movie made me dumber.) The end consists of the lead idiot killing the mother ant (a big blob thing) which destroys all the other ants. Pretty cliche eh? He almost wusses out at the end because of a sudden emotional attachment to the mother-thing that overcomes him. Give me a break.\n",

      "A SOUND OF THUNDER. One of the greatest short stories ever written. By one of the grandest Grand Masters of Fantasy  Ray Bradbury. What a great story.  But what a vomitous movie!   In Bradbury's science fiction short story  a company called Time Safari offers big game hunters the opportunity to go back in time and kill dinosaurs. Rule Number One is: Stay On The Path  a floating metallic walkway that ensures no interaction with the prehistoric environment. During a hunt  a man steps off the path and inadvertently crushes a butterfly. When the hunting party returns to the present - the world as they know it has drastically changed. Though there are paradoxes in any time travel story  Bradbury's tale was a quick jugular stroke  a parable of the ripple effect.  A Sound of Thunder was published in 1952 (according to Wikipedia  the most republished science fiction story of all time)  and illustrated Chaos Theory  Darwinism  and The Butterfly Effect (which would only be coined in the 1960s by Edward Lorenz). In Bradbury's story  the wonder of time travel was overshadowed by corporate greed  in turn overshadowed by the mortal danger to humanity's existence itself.  While in the movie  A SOUND OF THUNDER (directed by the uneven Peter Hyams  CAPRICORN ONE  2010: ODYSSEY TWO)  a clutch of bad actors goes through the time portal again and again to try to rectify their mistakes  like an excrement version of BACK TO THE FUTURE. The movie has nothing to do with Bradbury's powerful tale  except the initial jolt of the time traveling prehistoric hunting party. Egregious liberties are taken with Bradbury's story - baboon-faced reptiles  plants overrunning Chicago's concrete  time waves rippling through the city  CGI insectoids - for which Bradbury should sue the pants and underpants and ass-hairs off the filmmakers.  Novice writers Thomas Dean Donnelly  Joshua Oppenheimer and Gregory Poirier should start a Big Balls Agency  for thinking they could actually add elements to a Ray Bradbury story that would improve it. How do these guys walk in a straight line with balls this big? Ben Kingsley is the corporate owner of Time Safari  with a hairpiece so bad it looks like a hairpiece  Edward Burns is his lead hunter  Travis  and Catherine McCormack (who was Murron MacClannough  in BRAVEHEART) is the scientist with the best breasts.  I can't possibly relate the hundreds upon thousands of egregious stupidities and asinine pieces of dialog  but here is just one  spoken by David Oyelowo as some kind of scientist: he refers to the Pleiades star cluster  The Seven Sisters  they look like stars  don't they? But each of them is a whole galaxy. Uh  no  idiot scientist  they're actually  uh  stars.  Those three morons who rewrote Bradbury's story forgot they didn't know anything about physics or astronomy. Or writing.  Best part of the movie is Catherine McCormick's chest straining against her disheveled one-size-too-small blouses.  --Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).\n",

      "Fat Girls is among the worst films within the indie gay genre.  The premise is promising: an average-looking gay teen is trapped in a repressive small TX town. His only kindred spirits are the other village HS misfits: the class 'fat girl'  a naïve immigrant from Cuba  and the sensitive drama teacher. So far  interesting. In theory  this plot line creates a decent setup for an appealing coming of age story with a built-in audience---the thousands of gay men who grew up in small towns across America and experienced this adolescent anxiety first hand  peppered with a dose of self-deprecating humor.  Unfortunately  rather than a nuanced dramedy  Ash Christian approaches his autobiographical subject matter with a poorly executed attempt at irony and dark humor. The result is a cast of unlikeable  derivative  two-dimensional characters which the viewer cannot but help feel indifferent toward. Sabrina (Fink) is a quasi-Goth bitter navel-gazer. She is such a prickly  unsympathetic person; there is little doubt as to the reason for her friendless condition. The chemistry between her and Rodney (Christian) registers zero. This may have been bad casting  but is more likely due to a screenplay which is simply unsalvageable. Consequently  one is left wondering when there is such a non-existent bond  what could possibly warrant their near-constant companionship throughout the story.  Sabrina's newfound boyfriend  Rudy (de Jesus)  and Rodney's mother Judy (Theaker) are among the most exaggerated of the clichéd stock characters ripped off from dozens of other films. Rudy is the horny undersexed immigrant/nerd lifted directly from every raunchy adolescent comedy ever made within the realm of TV or film. Judy is the born-again obsessed with Jesus- talk and big hair. Just when you thought the Tammy Faye thing had been done to death  Christian inserts a scene where Judy's mascara is running with her tears! Is there anyone in the civilized world that can possibly think this tired old stereotype gag is still funny after seeing it ad nauseum for 20 years?  In addition to the failed attempts at sardonic humor  there are many puzzling story inconsistencies. Rodney considers himself a fat ugly loser. However  he simultaneously manages to participate in casual and regular impromptu trysts with the ubiquitous school jock/hunk  Ted (Miller). Although these liaisons are devoid of emotional fulfillment  most gay teens (filled with raging testosterone  just like their hetero brethren) would find this to be a rather enviable arrangement given the more common alternative of involuntary celibacy.  Rodney finds an object for his affection in Bobby (Bruening)  an exotic transplant from England. Against all believable odds  the lad not only happens to land in this tiny TX hamlet  but is conveniently openly gay to boot. Like Sabrina  Bobby is an icy  angry smart aleck and the viewer is left head-scratching as to his magnetic appeal.   Much to his delight  Rodney is invited by his new crush to the town gay bar  where Bobby claims to be the DJ. Upon arrival  the boyfriend-to-be promptly leaves Rodney solo and heads off to another area of the bar for a quick encounter with a rather handsome young man. This is yet one more of the ridiculously inexplicable plot elements since Rodney's feeling as an outcast are supposedly derived largely from his lonely existence in a parochial town. As tiny as the town is  they have openly gay students at the high school? A secretly bisexual football captain? Lesbian moms? A Gay teacher? and it has a gay bar downtown (patronized by attractive men  no less)? Apparently  the place is not so backwater after all.  Ten years earlier  Todd Stephens' Edge of Seventeen covered nearly the same material with a much more creative  honest  touching  and humorous film.\n",

      "Korine's established himself  by now  as a talented and impressive image-maker. The promotional posters for Mister Lonely all include the film's most impressive compositions (though there's one in particular I've yet to see in promo material: that of a blue-clad nun teasing a dog with a stick  surrounded by green forest with torrential rain pouring down). The opening images of this film  of Michael Jackson lookalike (Diego Luna) riding a small motorbike round a track  is strangely compelling and beautiful: Roy Orbison's Mister Lonely plays on the soundtrack  and the images unfold in slow-motion. There's also a funny and terrific sequence in which the same character mimes a dance  without music (though a radio sits like a silent dog next to him)  in the middle of a Paris street; Korine splices in sound effects and jump-cuts that evoke both a feeling of futility and dogged liberation in the character's dance routine.  The first instance of the segment dealing with the nuns is also strangely poignant; Father Umbrillo (Werner Herzog) is an autocratic priest about to fly with some nuns over  and drop food into  impoverished areas nearby. In a scene that is both light-hearted and affecting  Herzog must deal with a stubbornly enthusiastic local who wishes to make the plane trip with them in order to see his wife in San Francisco. As the exchange develops  Herzog draws out of the man a confession: he has sinned  and his frequent infidelity is the cause of his wife having left him in the first place. This scene  short and sweet  gains particular weight after one learns its improvised origins: the sinner is played by a non-actor who was on set when Korine and co. were filming - and his adulterous ways had given him  in real life  a lasting  overwhelming guilt.  Henceforth  the film is hit-and-miss; a succession of intrinsically interesting moments that add to a frivolous  muddled narrative. Whereas Gummo and Julien Donkey-Boy maintain their aesthetic and emotional weight via coherent structural frameworks  Mister Lonely feels like a victim of editing room ruthlessness. A few scenes were cut from the film  which would have otherwise painted fuller pictures of certain characters  due to continuity errors in costume - a result  no doubt  due to the absence of a shooting script and Korine's tendency for improvisation. One deleted scene in particular - in which 'Charlie Chaplin' (Denis Lavant) and 'Madonna' (Melita Morgan) have sex - would have added much more emotional conflict to a scene later on in the film (I won't spoil it  but it's there to deflate any feeling of warmth or celebration  and  as it is  only half-succeeds).  The two strands of the narrative  unconnected literally  are best approached as two entirely different stories with the same allegorical meaning; one compliments the other and vice versa. (It's something to do with the conflict between one's ambitions and the reality of the current situation.) But there's not enough of the Herzog scenes to merit their place in the film  and so any connection between these two allegorically-connected threads is inevitably strained - and the inclusion is  in retrospect  tedious.  This is an ambitious step forward from Julien Donkey-Boy that suffers mostly  at least in the lookalike segments  from having far too many characters for the film's running length  a flaw that would have been even worse had big star names played everyone (as was originally planned).  With many of the imagery's self-contained beauty  and moments of real  genuine connection with the soundtrack  this feels like it'd be much more suited to an art installation or photo exhibition. As an exploration of mimesis and the nature of impersonation  it'd lose none of its power - indeed  for me  it would perhaps be more impressive. The loneliness attached to iconic performativity (such as that encountered by both the icons themselves and those who aspire to be like them) is well-captured in images such as that wherein 'Marilyn Monroe' (a gorgeous Samantha Morton) seduces the camera with a Seven Year Itch pose in the middle of a forest  or when 'Sammy Davis  Jr.' (Jason Pennycooke) settles  post-dance rehearsal  with his back to the camera overlooking an incredible  tranquil lake.  As it is  moments like these  and all those where the titles of randomly-chosen Michael Jackson songs crawl across the scene  are married to one another in a film narrative far less affecting than it should be.  (For those who see it  I lost all faith during the egg-singing scene  late on. You'll know which scene I mean because it sticks out like a sore thumb  as some sort of gimmicky attempt at the new cinematic language for which Korine has previously been hailed.)\n",

      "This is one of those films you can have on for a couple of hours on a Sunday morning -- able to do other things with no real complications in losing any understanding of the proceedings  and gaining some fascination in wondering why such mediocrities acquired the manpower and financial resources to be produced in the first place.  Of course  with all the cable channels  as well as Lifetime's need to fill its time slots with 100 or so hours worth of movies per week (along with incessant Golden Girls reruns)  this type of fare is now a t.v. staple. Also  it seems these flicks provide livelihood to the Canadian locales where most are made  as well as the host of Canadian actors appearing in them.  Tori Spelling  like the ferret-face Paris Hilton  is somebody who - if not for family connections and resources - would likely be working at The Gap. But at least Tori has become  say  a C+-level thespian  appearing in occasional presentations appropriate to this level.  This story is one which has been seen on Lifetime and similar venues God-knows-how-many times. Devious woman  a total sociopath  trying to screw-up everyone else's lives  operating during the initial parts of the story with more cleverness than a CIA operative could muster  committing murder when necessary  and out to wreck the life of the flick's heroine.  As usual  the male lead is a completely clueless dolt. And in these types of films  one finds  say  characters about whom one can really care  about 10% of the time. This one is in the other 90%.\n",

      "My house mate and I foolishly purchased the video of 'The Roller Blade Seven' from our local second hand video shop in the hope of finding a bad film to laugh at. This film isn't even laughable  it's pathetically poor  worse even than Jack Frost 2-and that's saying something. The script  acting  production  stunts  sound  sets  everything is absolutely terrible. In some parts the actors haven't even learned their lines and are blatantly ad-libbing or in one case actually having the lines read to them off set and simply repeating them. Set in the post apocalyptic 'Wheel Zone' The film obviously consists of about 45 minutes of film  many parts of which are edited badly or repeated ad nauseum from various different camera angles to make the film longer. This gets tedious very quickly. The plot makes no sense whatsoever (It is apparently an amalgam of two books written by Scott Shaw)  there aren't even seven of them  most of them aren't on blades  they're wearing roller boots  and it seems to me that mostly the film has been completely sold on the fact that there's about 3 minutes of female semi-nudity in it. The writer and star Scott Shaw obviously fancies himself somewhat of a Samurai and throughout the film performs some very poor stunts and made up sword fighting moves that look massively amateurish. Despite all this  his website states that the film should never be compared to a traditional film because it really pushes the boundaries of modern film making. My house mate and I were left speechless by the whole ordeal  and despite my frequent attempts to burn the videotape  she has decided it may be some kind of Ring-esquire video curse that needs to be passed on.

      "Maybe it gets better. I wouldn't know. I made it through the first twenty minutes or so before cutting it off and entering a period of mourning. It was obvious that the plot itself was a familiar one. A man  Paul LeMatt  a professor of entymology at Columbia  drives with his dog to a small town in Ohio in search of his ex wife  Diana Scarwid. There he encounters people who either ignore him or are hostile. Oh  they may smile but there's something going on underneath.  That sort of arrangement is home turf for movie makers and viewers alike  and it's pregnant with possibilities. You can turn out a neatly drawn commercial success like Bad Day at Black Rock. Or it would have made  and probably DID make  a nice Twilight Zone episode.  The cast includes some seasoned performers too  as well as some formerly prominent names. Kenneth Toby  a veteran of science fiction  is the superficially amiable motel manager. Diana Scarwid can give an impressive performance  as she did in  say  Silkwood. For some of the others  their range is limited.  But it's poorly directed and shabbily written.  Example of shabby direction. That dog of LeMatt's is disliked by Kenneth Toby  right off the bat. So when LeMatt walks out to the street  Toby sneaks up to the window of his room  peers in at the dog  and something zaps. Cut to LeMatt in the street. He hears his dog howling away. Then a POV shot of presumably the dog zipping along towards LeMatt then past him while the wind blows and LeMatt gawks at the camera. Cut to an identical shot -- coming from the other direction! Whatever the camera represents  whatever LeMatt is staring at  is never shown. Maybe it was nothing  because suddenly the wind stops and LeMatt is alone in the street  looking a little bit puzzled. You should never have brought that dog in the first place  remarks a smiling Toby from the porch. Question: What the hell is that scene all about?   Example of shabby writing. Well  TWO examples. (1) If you were to sit down and write a stereotypical waitress in a small-town diner  without the exercise of any craft whatever  you'd come up with an expressionless babe with her hair piled on top of her head  chewing gum  sauntering among the tables. Right. (2) Anything resembling believability is thrown out the window in favor of special effects. LeMatt's car chugs to a halt  then explodes while it is waiting to be fixed at the garage. Chugging to a halt: believable. Exploding: supernatural. Not even Edgar Allan Poe would endorse such an event.  And the invaders themselves? Think of a modest masterpiece like Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Something is going wrong in Dr. Kevin McCarthy's small town  and it takes half the movie for the mystery to be unraveled  and all the time suspense is building and doubt is growing. Here  twenty minutes into the movie  a stranger walks into a motel room and tears off his plastic face  revealing a pulsing  light-emitting  naked brain. The pregnancy is aborted.  I won't tell you the ending because I don't know what it is  nor do I care. I suppose it had something to do with insects because why else would Paul LeMatt be an entymologist? (By the way  who's handling his classes?) But I'm not even sure bugs were involved. It's entirely possible that the bug business was adventitious. The writers may have made him a specialist in insects and then forgot all about it. It wouldn't surprise me.\n",

      "I wrote this as a two part review. Part two has spoilers.  Part 1:   No  this isn't that one about the sex with car accidents. This is the one about racism in L.A. You know  the one where everybody is a racist  and race is the topic on everybody's mind at all times. Race.  Its like the movie has a form of turrets syndrome where race is the constant theme. Race. Racist. Racism. Race Relations. Relay race.  Paul Haggis made a movie which took the structure of Magnolia  which was used to show the disconnect of people who are tangentially connected  and then screwed it into a 1'53 mental vomit about racism in America. RACE. In the 24 hour period we have 7 stories running parallel all connected and about race. The first hour  people say ridiculous stuff and do absurd things in an effort to be real about racism in America.  For example  the story with Ludicrous and Larenz Tate provides the comic relief. Too bad  the first half of their story is lifted straight from The Bonnie Situation in Pulp Fiction. RACISM. Their section is the Quentin Tarantino section where  instead of being cool and talking about foot massages and religion  the characters talk about race and racism. CONSTANTLY.   The other good thing about it is the Mexican story when the Mexican guy is talking to his daughter. He gives her his invisible impenetrable cloak to protect her from bullets. Decent writing  but that's only because the writers have had daughters and know what they would say in his place.  The rest of the stories are extremely ludicrous. The Hindi does not act in any semblance of realism. The scene where he's trying to get the lock fixed and the Mexican tells him he needs a new door is abbreviated and stupid. Why would anybody act like that? Is it realistic? NOOO. It reminds me more of the convenience store clerk from The Doom Generation. Six Dollar Sixty Six Cents girly. If i ever watch the second half of the movie  I hope his head is shot off and his bodiless head starts coughing up relish.  I haven't mentioned race in over a paragraph. RACE. RACISM. RACE FOR THE SUN. Better. Then  there is the black guy who wants to be white  Matt Dillon who has a chip on his shoulder against blacks  Ryan Phillippe who looks beautiful and does nothing  and various other bad actors acting badly with bad dialog. When Matt Dillon molests the black producers wife  could I help it if I was cracking up? When Philippe is second guessing his writing up of his partner for racism  can I help but crack up? The movie is so funny when it is being racist. Racist. RACIST I tell you.  Now  mind you  this movie was nominated for Best Picture  Best Director  Best Screenplay  and Best Editing  besides a nod to Matt Dillon who actually did attempt to do a decent job. Who was paid off for that one  I have no clue.  Don't see it unless you feel like being preached at about the racism in society through a bad and unrealistic script from 2 white men over fifty who have no semblance of reality or interaction with real society in any way shape or form.  D-   Part 2:  The second half of Crash takes any and all story lines in the first half...and spews them back out in a sort of redemptive  conclusionary  the world is a big coincidence kind of way. And it is in fact one of the worst ways to do it.  Take 1999's Magnolia. People weren't conveniently tied together over and over again. They were just connected in a strange way that happens more often than you think. You know somebody who knows somebody who did something that you knew somebody else was also involved in. Crash takes this wrapping into a serious extreme.  The stories are lined up so everybody meets again. Are there only 5 on the LAPD force? Aren't these people working weird shifts? Dillon and Philippe were a late shift then an early one the next day? And  why did Tate have to be the murdered hitchhiker? Wouldn't it have had more emotional tension  as well as realism  if it had been somebody we had not been following all day long? Like Phillippe just picks up a random hitchhiker and then freaks out. Everybody'd be freaking out.  Eventually  in the second half  the touching invisible cloak scene is used to get the Hindi to shoot the daughter. It ticked me off and made me feel dirty. Not that the Hindi shot the daughter  but that they created a beautiful touching scene and then had it be the direct cause of people tearing up. It really ticked me off. At the writers  not the scene.  The whole movie is fake and totally uncalled for. The coincidences are far too many and they require an extreme suspension of disbelief. Unlike Magnolia which was connected mildly  this had connections upon connections upon connections which were just so over-the-top. The only good part in the second half was when Sandra Bullock falls down the stairs. She doesn't die though. She should have. I cheered when she fell.  The worst part about the movie is it pulls a Magnolia. Not just in structure  but it has a montage over the song In the Deep where you see everybody being depressed. Magnolia took this and had post-modern commentary on it by having all of the characters singing along to Aimee Mann's Wise Up. Unfortunately  Magnolia came out in 1999  while Crash came out in 2005. Its hard to make commentary on a movie which won't be made for another 6 years  but it happened. Somehow.  Utter waste of my time.  First half: D-; Second half: lowest grade ever; Overall: F---\n",

I never thought I would see the day when they would jump on the Hollywood sleaze bandwagon  but here it is: Scooter as a caged rave dancer  Pepe making lewd and suggestive comments every five minutes -- this is not your father's Muppets. It's not Jim Henson's Muppets anymore  either.  This It's A Wonderful Life themed movie has its moments  but not enough to save it. I cringed while watching this with my children.

      "I made a big mistake going to see this film. That's the lottery of going to see films I guess. After five minutes you just knew it was going to be a clunker  and I fought quite hard to stay in my seat - the old lose two hours of your life kind of feeling.  The fundamental problem is that  without even mentioning the whole historical accuracy thread of reviews  the script is achingly  painful  bad.  The first thirty minutes could have been spread out to an hour to give a plausible  real  plot development. Instead  it lurched from from one undramatic dramatic event to the next. Having the girl cry at the start of the film makes no sense because the audience has no emotional attachment to anything at this point. And that whole walking off into the sunset through the long-grass field at the end  what the hell was that about?   Not even the excellent Ed Harris could save this one. You could almost feel his pain at some of the lines he had to utter. The most fabulously awful one was  for no apparent reason  he stares at the girl as she copies his work in his apartment  she looks up  it all goes a bit fuzzy romantic kind-a lighting (or am I dreaming)  and he says  with authority in his voice    WASH ME.   And she gets up and washes him  with a sponge. Wash me WTF? That's hilarious.  And then there was the music. The long extended session when it was just Beethoven conducting and the 9th Symphony pouring out of the surround sound in the cinema and the choir waiting  waiting  standing there silently for what seems like forever. And then  finally  launching into enormous sound. It was spine-chillingly wonderful and dare I say it  it brought tears to my eyes.  So that is where the film picked up two stars. The only part of the film where Beethoven got to say exactly what he wanted to say.  And I believed him.\n",

      "The Fanglys is set in a small Texan town called Layton on the eve of Halloween as the townspeople treat it like the second coming of Christ or something  I mean Halloween isn't that important is it? Anyway  Sheriff Pete (Burton Gilliam) has been called out to yet another murder as local boy Ned (co-associate producer John William Galt) has discovered a body in the local woods. Could it be the Fang Lady (Justin Hamilton)? The central character involved in a local legend about a witch who kills teenagers  who knows? Being the fun sort of guy he is Mark (asisstant director & producer Robert Harvey) convinces his missus Kelly (Laurie Reeves) to ride out to a cemetery that his mate Steven (Josh Gobin) found the night before for a Halloween party. The idea of spending the night in a cemetery in the middle of the woods obviously appeals to Kelly & she agrees  along with Steven & a girl he picked up named Camille (Natalie Woods) & their nerdy friend Jerry (Tim Boswell) they all set out for a night of fun  well as much fun as you can expect to have in an isolated cemetery. However they soon discover that the legend of the Fang Lady is far from the bedtime story many make out...  Edited  executive produced  written & directed by Christopher Abram The Fanglys is a pretty rubbish attempt at a horror film. The script is very predictable  dull & doesn't deliver any sort of entertainment value whatsoever  in the right hands & with a decent budget The Fanglys could have been an effective horror film but as it is it isn't. It moves along at a fair pace but the on-screen 'action' is so poor that it doesn't matter  I don't quite know what else to say other than The Fanglys is a really bad film & I can't see anyone getting any sort of enjoyment out of it. The dialogue is basic  the character's are clichéd & lifeless while as a whole the film seems a lot longer than the 90 minutes running time. There are a few lame attempts at humour which don't sit that well along side the horror elements & what was that retard keeping in that cage? I'd imagine the budget didn't allow the filmmakers to show it. Oh  if you want to know what happens to Jerry at the end then you'll have too keep watching past the end credits as the lame truth is revealed  assuming you can actually make it that far of course (believe me it takes some doing).  Director Abram doesn't do anything special. Abram thinks bathing scenes in neon light is stylish  I can tell him that it isn't when your film is supposed to be set in the woods. There's no atmosphere  scares  tension  excitement or any of the elements that makes a good horror film good. Forget about decent gore  there's a bit when someone eats some skin off an arm & a pitchfork stuck through someones throat.  Apparently The Fanglys had a filming budget of $2 837 which makes it one of the lowest budget films ever to have a commercial release  & to be brutally honest it shows. What about the retarded guy & his false joke shop teeth that look ridiculous? The terrible special effects  the camcorder cinematography & the terrible acting from everyone involved that makes it even more of a pain to sit through.  The Fanglys is straight-to-video crap  it has no redeeming features whatsoever & it's low IMDb user rating score is fully justified  it's one of those films that within half an hour I was looking at the clock & wishing the thing would just finish.\n",

      "I love most Jet Li movies (with the exception of Romeo Must Die) and I bought this movie in a VERY cheap three-pack with The Master and Twin Warriors. While Twin Warriors was very impressive and I was thoroughly intrigued by it  and the master was a bit Karate Kid but also enjoyable  I thought this movie was TERRIBLE. I'm not just saying that because I'm used to better movies. I'm saying that it was almost down there with Kazaam. The fight scenes were terrible (blurry cameras and no real fighting) and the plot was your typical stupid kung-fu plot. If you are going to have a plot this stupid (see 'man turns into woman to become all-powerful then falls in love with Jet Li') you best have some great fighting to go with it.

      "Antonio Margheriti  director of the enjoyably cheesy cult horror Cannibal Apocalypse  helms this Gothic-flavoured giallo starring gap-toothed 70s icon Jane Birkin (as well as her massive-conked French lover of the day  Serge Gainsbourg).  Unfortunately  despite the inclusion of such treats as a tasty bi-sexual French teacher and a terribly unrealistic killer orangutan  Seven Deaths in the Cat's Eye ends up a dreary mess which is a struggle to endure.  Pretty schoolgirl Corringa (Birkin) returns to her family's Scottish estate after many years away  only to discover that a maniac is murdering her relatives one by one. Using the whole array of 'spooky old house' tricks (hidden doorways  dark corridors  creepy graveyards  candlelit cobweb covered rooms)  Margheriti cobbles together a confusing tale which at times promises supernatural goings-on  but ends up with a lame cop-out ending that is unimaginative in the extreme.  'And where exactly does the cat fit in to all of this?'  I hear you ask. Well  a rather pudgy moggy witnesses each murder thus justifying Margheriti's rather cool sounding title.

      "Dustin Hoffman's debut feature isn't as bad as it's reputed to be; a Spanish/Italian co-production filmed in Italy with the director using the pseudonym Dan Ash(!)  the film is uneven but generally diverting and deals with a plethora of shady characters in search of a $1 000 000 hidden by gangster Cesar Romero (who  despite being third-billed - after Elsa Martinelli and Hoffman himself - expires before the credit sequence has even rolled!).  Hoffman's performance  obviously  is nowhere near as nuanced as in later films but manages to dodge embarrassment by playing what basically amounts to an amiable klutz - an accident-prone American treasury agent of Sicilian descent (named Puzzu  which nobody seems to be able to get right!) sent out by his firm to retrieve the money and told to remain inconspicuous but  instead  is forever getting into trouble - though he ultimately proves surprisingly resourceful by finding the loot  foiling the crooks and winning the girl (Martinelli as Romero's daughter  who's somewhat wasted here)!!   Still  the film's best moments are provided by suave gangster Riccardo Garrone: apart from his would-be hard-boiled persona and the hilarious use of dialect  he's flanked by a trio of nitwits who more often than not prove a hindrance in the fulfillment of his various schemes! Also  in view of the story being set in Rome  it's odd that the police officer investigating the case is a Spaniard (doubtless an exigency of the co-production deal)!   Along the years  I've missed out on Hoffman's other Italian comedy - ALFREDO  ALFREDO (1972) - a number of times (I guess  mainly  because Leonard Maltin only rates it *1/2 in his Movies & Video Guide...but  then  MADIGAN'S MILLION gets a BOMB!); with Pietro Germi directing and co-starring the luscious Stefania Sandrelli  the credentials of that film are certainly more respectable  and I really hope it turns up again on Italian TV soon...\n",

      "It's proof that movie makers and their financiers treating their audience with contempt isn't a new phenomena as it was done as early as the 1940s and HOUSE OF Dracula is a great example . You'd think having a film with Dracula   the wolf man and Frankenstein's monster the producer would dictate to the screenwriter to have all three appear in a scene . They had a chance with HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN then when they had a second bite of the cherry they blew it again with HOUSE OF Dracula . To lose one chance is a misfortune   to lose two smacks of cynical money making   It's obvious the producers are beyond caring . Larry Talbot turns up again even though he was shown to die in the previous film which sums up the cynicism of the franchise . It also shows what a poor screenplay it is and we're mistreated to some awful plot turns like Talbot's condition being cured by a special type of plant which will soften his skull . I'm thinking screenwriter Edward T Lowe might have had his skull softened if this is the type of stuff he comes up with   Director Erie C Kenton can't improve on the script and throws in a few spanners of his own . For example Talbot is startled to see Dr Edelmann snatch a lift on a cart but nonchalantly watches Edelmann climb a wall and jump in to the château courtyard . One can't help thinking Talbot's reaction shots were mistakenly switched round at the editing stage   Lon Chaney Jnr is famous for his roles in horror movies but didn't have much of a career outside them . Perhaps that's down to the fact he's not a good actor and here he commits the worst type of acting - being very wooden . It's not entirely his fault though because all the characters spout rather awful dialogue and are all rather wooden due in part to Kenton's lackluster directing   HOUSE OF Dracula feels a million miles away from James Whale 1931 film and its sequel from 1935 and would have been a very sad note to end on . But ironically Universal decided to make one more movie to wrap up their franchise with a horror comedy starring Abbot and Costello\n",

      "After a humiliating experience on an airplane  Nashawn Wade (Kevin Hart) sues the airline and uses the money he wins to start up his own full-service airline. What makes his different is that it has sexy stewardesses  an on board dance club and no less than Captain Snoop Dogg in the cockpit.  Soul Plane is a very racist comedy except it is only occasionally funny. Soul Plane has been described as an urban version of Airplane. The problem is that Soul Plane doesn't even come close to achieving the laughs of Airplane. The jokes in Soul Pane are too offensive and they are mostly unoriginal. I would be lying if I said I didn't laugh since there were some funny moments. However  I was expecting more and I left the theater disappointed.  I would compare Soul Plane to Airplane 2. The latter was just a rehash of the first film while the former is just a rehash of outdated  crude jokes. There is really no creativity behind the movie and there are only a few fun spots. However  I don't think Soul Plane is bottom 100 bad. Right now  the movie is ranked at number 82 and that's a little harsh. I'm not saying this is a good movie but it isn't a terrible on either. The running time is only 86 minutes long so it isn't too much of a pain to watch. For stupid comedies  you can do a lot worse.  No one in the cast is very good but they all seem to be having fun and this helps. Kevin Hart was very annoying as Nashawn. He had a few funny lines but he is a very poor leading man. Snoop Dogg  who was mildly funny in Starsky and Hutch  completely flunks here. Tom Arnold was actually tolerable and that was the film's biggest surprise. The most annoying person in the movie was Ryan Pinkston. He was not funny at all and he will never be funny. The funniest cast members were Missi Pyle and Mo'Nique. They gave the best lines and they made me laugh the most. In the end  Soul Plane may fit the bill if you're looking for a stupid comedy but it would probably be better if you just skip the film.

      "I'm starting to wonder if all these PG-13 horror movies are just glorified screen tests for young and emerging talent. Get a first-time screenwriter  an inexperienced director  a few TV actors looking for their bigscreen break and see what they can do. 'When a Stranger Calls' is a little better than most such recent offerings  but is still completely by-the-book; riddled with plot holes and genre clichés.  The story is unbelievably simplistic. The slim 87 minute running time is heavily padded with inconsequential friends and a pointless cheating boyfriend. The killer is devoid of even the token motivation of Jason or Michael or even the original movie's killer  and as a result is never particularly frightening. The police behave in such an unbelievably ineffectual and lazy manner as to verge on professional misconduct. Simon West brings the same attractive banality to proceedings that he managed with Lara Croft  but his style of directing is decidedly generic  possessing no indicators of real talent or vision. The performances are routine  dark hallways replace genuine horror  and the scares are of the tired cat-in-the-closet variety.  The cinematography and production design  however  are above average for this kind of film. The house is beautifully designed  all dark wood and glassy reflections  and there are a few moments that are of visual interest.  Though lacking an ounce of dramatic originality  it acts as a reasonably satisfying 'dark house' thriller  and maintains interest longer than most of its ilk.\n",

There certainly appeared to be pathetic attempts at take-offs of other films  Jaws and European Vacation to name but two.  If memory serves me right Eric Idle played the same type of character in Nat Lamp European Vacation  but much better.  I am wondering if Chevy Chase and Beverley D'Angelo were approached to make this sequel. If so  they certainly knew what they were doing when they turned their parts down.  In my opinion no one can better Chevy and Beverley in their roles as the Griswolds and Randy Quaid complemented them admirably in the earlier movies.  Randy Quaid should have quit National Lampoon whilst he was ahead.\n",

      "I am a fan of good historical fiction  and was thrilled at the thought that someone would take a well written book series and film it. Writing scripts is not like writing regular fiction  but when you have a book you are adapting  it would be nice to actually follow the plot line.  The portrayals of the Vespasians (the actual Emperor  and his 2 sons Titus and Domitian) was horrid. They acted like a cookie cutter Caligula  and were the 'bad guys' in this adaptation. There was a scene with Titus dispensing justice as if he was Caligula (from the movie of the same name.) The way the Vespasianii are portrayed in the books mostly follow the reports of historians writing in that time period - they were fair  and sane  not tainted by the Imperial Claudian insanity.  Helena (the love interest of Marcus Didius Falco) gives as her reason for divorcing Pertinax (one of the traitors referenced in the title) was that he was a traitor  yet in the books it was because he ignored her and she felt that she would be better off marrying someone who valued her as a person.  Marcus in the movie gets a slave named Justus  yet in the books he could barely afford his apartment  let alone afford a slave. There was certainly no romantic interlude between the nonexistent slave Justus and a female gladiator...  On the whole  if you want good cookie cutter roman stereotypes get Caligula  if you want good roman from the classical history viewpoint  get I  Claudius.\n",

      "O boy  was this really bad.  I saw this on videotape.  In scenes that had soundtrack music  it was hard to hear the dialog. When people were on the telephone  it was hard to hear the person on the other end. It appeared that at least two different kinds of film or video stock were used  because the colors and focus sometimes shifted drastically between edits. And there were a lot of out of focus shots that didn't seem intentional.  One indicator of the budget (one of many) was when a news report comes on TV. There is just a news flash title card badly superimposed with a video effect onto a TV screen  and a voice-over by a newscaster. They couldn't shoot footage of a newscaster  and then actually show it on the TV?  The movie starts off with a killer wearing surgical scrubs and mask  wielding a scalpel. Supposedly he's a paranoid schizophrenic who escapes from the hospital to avoid having a lobotomy performed on him.  Students are let out of school for a break  and three young women decide to have a slumber party. Three guys decide to crash the party  and a geek named Science decides to crash it too. The slumber party is pretty boring  and the guys just keep showing up randomly wearing masks  taking the masks off  and then disappearing. The mother and father (the surgeon who was to do the lobotomy) of one of the girls keep showing up too. The killer knocks slices people's throats without anyone really noticing. The apparent lead of the movie more or less sleepwalks through the movie. Perhaps that was bad acting  or maybe it was intentional  since much of the movie is a nightmare  and some of it a nightmare within a nightmare.  The ending is really horrible too.  The best thing about the movie is the cheesy United Home Video VHS box art  which was revived for the DVD release (a double feature with Terror at Tenkiller). I honestly can't tell if it is a photo  or a painting  or a combination of both. The women pictured on the cover are not in the movie  and the clothing they're wearing is way more revealing than anything the women in the movie wore. The throat slicing on the cover is scarier than the ones in the movie - where people tend to affect a goofy pop-eyed look. For that matter  that's what the killer has most of the time: head cocked  and eyes bugging out  mugging for the camera. Frequently the scalpel was held up close to the camera in focus  while the killer's mask-covered face was in close-up but out of focus in the background.\n",

Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) now this woman is stereotypical angry  butch feminist. I think in one episode she is thought to be a lesbian  but apparently is not...What a shame she's almost interesting.  Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) the most annoying character. I swear I thought I was watching Twisted Sister front man Dee Snider's more manly looking  cross dressing  sissy boy  brother! This is a girl looking for can't live without you love....Heard of a puppy?  This show is stupid and I love making fun of it because I hear about how it is some kind of new awakening for women. That is just sad if your looking to watch slutty  pathetic  addictive people in way too expensive clothes drinking cosmopolitans and sounding like an annoying 15 yr old on cocaine than there is a show for you............just use protection.\n",

      "Where do I begin  its one of the most frustrating movies I've seen because it makes a lot of sense in terms of the point but it comes off as seriously stupid. A movie about a ghost inhabited bed?? The first 2 minutes of the movie shows a black and white flashback of a weird looking fat dude going dominatrix on a Fabienne from Pulp Fiction lookalike contest winner and strangles her with his tie. This is supposed to set up how the bed factors into the story. Still though  if you wanted an opening to keep people interested or send them away early  having a strangulation is the way to do it. Fast forward to the present day  a married couple moves into an apartment with a friendly landlord and begins unpacking their things  so far everything's normal. Then one night while doing the hippity dippity on a single mattress  they realize they need a bed frame. This is where things get fishy  why didn't they bring or buy a g*d damn bed frame before they got there? We learn that the door leading to the attic where the first 2 minutes took place doesn't open but then once the couple realizes they need a bed frame  the door magically opens. They go up to the attic and discover the old bed frame and decide to bring it downstairs and their lovemaking days are saved...or so they thought. The rest of the movie centers around the both of them being haunted by the bedframe. The female is an artist so she starts drawing up the ghoulish images she dreams about and the male is a photographer so he starts having his models act as if they're bring tortured or tied up.(one of which has gray hair and appears over 50 years old  yuck) The female grows increasingly scared and she discovers the house she lives in was once a haven for serial killings and murders which bring about the end to the movie. They find the friendly landlord murdered (which makes no sense since ghosts need to take a human form to kill) and decide to get the hell out of dodge. While packing up  the husband moronically goes up into the attic where he is possessed by the crazy fat dude and the female bashes his skull in before the cops show up and take her to a mental ward where she kills some dude trying to hit on her.  Well if you've read this far you have to be thinking one thing.......WHY THE HELL DIDN'T THEY JUST THROW THE BEDFRAME OUT THE WINDOW???? Seriously  they never said anything about the actual house being haunted  just the bed....so why not get rid of the damn thing and move on? That's why the movie is so frustrating because it actually is a good plot and the actors follow suit accordingly but there are more holes in it than Sonny Corleone at a toll booth. The couple did try to leave town as upposed to every other movie that has the ol oh lets give this place a chance honey scheme going  so props to that. Still though  me and my buddy who watched the movie kept saying every 5 minutes....why didn't they just throw the bed out? Especially once they learned it was haunted would have been a good time to set it on fire or something.  All in all its a near-watchable movie with plenty of porno like bed scenes and a believable plot (to an extent) but the solution is so simple you're scratching your head by the end of the movie wondering how stupid can the married couple be? The highlight of the movie is when the husband tells the 50 year old model to spread her legs and his assistant tells him that he can't shoot her like that.  4 out of 10 (a low budget porno The Man Show would love)\n",

      "CAUTION SPOILER: At the end of the movie it is announced that the bridge collapsed just a few days after it was captured. The impression is that the attack was all for nothing. In reality  taking the bridge at Remagen was the last important victory for the Western Allies. It was the crossing of the Rhine that the Allies had been trying to achieve for six months. Because the Remagen Bridge was taken  the war ended in just a few weeks.  The bridge only need to last for a day after it was captured. This was enough time for the Americans to send combat engineers and a large protective force to the other side  and they could then start building a series of pontoon bridges. The taking of the bridge was a complete success  and meant the that the end of the war was near  and would not last through the summer. Contrary to the cynical nature of the film  the victory was heralded with elation by the troops who did it. They knew how vital the battle was.  This film has little to do with real history. It was more a reflection of the cynical nature of the time in which it was produced.\n",

      "After having problems in Chicago  the Solomon family moves to a remote North Dakota farmhouse to start anew  but their attempts at an idyllic farming life is disrupted when their teen daughter Jess (Kristen Stewart) and her 3-year-old brother Ben start seeing and being attacked by supernatural beings who won't allow them to live in peace.  The Messengers starts off decently although it eventually becomes a generic horror film that's a lot more humorous than frightening. After reading the premise  I thought this could have been a decent movie since it sounded creepy and it held potential. Unfortunately  the film didn't live up to its potential although I should have expected this since the trailer was awful. The screenplay was probably the worst part about it. It was full of silly sequences and bland dialog. The characters were not developed at all and most of them were acting like a bunch of idiots so it was hard to feel sympathy for them.  The directors did a horrible job at building up suspense. They mainly relied on cheap scares like loud noises and random jumps. The music was really over the top and it just made it easier for the viewer to telegraph the next scary moment. I also didn't like how they pretty much just used one location for the whole movie. The house was the centerpiece of the story and that's where the majority of the filming took place so it got a little boring after awhile to see the same area. Also  I didn't like the close-ups of the actors. During a conversation  the camera would continually jerk from character to another in the span of five seconds and it got really annoying. The directors did create a decent atmosphere and they do get some points for making their movie stylish. However  since we have come a long way in terms of style and effects  it's not really that hard to make your movie look nice especially if you are working on a Hollywood film.  The acting was atrocious and if this movie had been released in December  I'm sure it would have received several Razzie nominations. Kristen Stewart showed some talent in Panic Room but you wouldn't be able to tell she has talent by watching her performance in The Messengers. She was okay at acting scared and that's it. The rest of the time she was dry and unconvincing. Penelope Anne Miller was just awful when it came to everything. It sounded like she was reading her lines and she had some of the worst facial expressions I have ever seen. Dylan McDermott was just very wooden and he showed almost no emotion. John Corbett gave the best performance and he had a couple of good scenes. The twins who played Ben were also decent and managed to out act many of the adult actors. Overall  this lame horror film is not worth watching because of it's blandness and lazy film-making. Rating 4/10\n",

      "Maybe  like most others who have seen this film long after it's premiere on television  I wanted to see many of my favorite actors in old and obscure form  which is exactly what 'Slow Burn' is. Except  aside from the nostalgic value  the movie itself is not very good.  Eric Roberts plays former reporter Jacob Ash  hired by a Gerald McMurty (Raymond J. Barry)  a rich artist  to investigate the whereabouts of his estranged son  Brian  who had been living with his mother  Laine (Beverly D'Angelo) for the past few years. In a Phillip Marlowe-esquire fashion Jacob Ash narrates what would become more than just an investigation into the whereabouts of Brian. But  once Jacob tracks down Laine  his discoveries break open wide a whole lot of trouble. Perhaps because events in the film move too slowly  there is never much suspense to this little thriller  not even by the end with the finale routine of revealing the culprits and their motives.  However  as said before  this movie is probably one that will draw attention for it's then-relatively unknown cast of actors  which include both a very young Eric Roberts as well as the adorable Johnny Depp  who plays Laine's stepson  Donnie. That may be reason enough to give it a try...if you can find it.\n",

      "This movie starts off on the wrong foot and never really gets it going. The first scene shows a Life Flight helicopter landing and just outside the window you can distinctly see mountains in the background. For those of you who might not ever have been to Houston there is no elevation change. The city sits just above sea level and a 5 ft. incline is considered a big hill. To go along with that scenery  any shots outside of the hospital immediately tell the viewer that they are not in Houston. The trees are all missing leaves or are pine trees  neither of which Houston has very much of. Even the hospital itself  on the outside  is very unbelievable. Memorial Hermann Hospital is one of the top hospitals in the United States and sits smack dab in the middle of the Medical District just miles from downtown Houston  yet every outside shot of the hospital makes it appear that the hospital is out in the suburbs or even the countryside.  It is obvious that whoever was in charge of the actual tropical storm part of the movie skimped out because the numerous shots of radar are all wrong. The first radar image in the movie is that of Hurrican Hugo hitting South Carolina. We later see Kris Kristofferson leaving his job and one of his assistants tells him that Alison is moving back south across Houston yet the radar image he shows has Alison clearly moving north off of the Gulf of Mexico into Houston...probably the initial landfall of Alison.  As for the acting  it isn't all that bad. JoBeth Williams  Kris Kristofferson and Rick Schroder all do a decent job considering that this is a straight-to-TV movie. The plot of the story is decent and the fact that it is based on a true story makes it a bit more entertaining. My one problem with the acting is the portrayal of Houstonians with big thick Southern accents...the actors all sound like they are from Birmingham  Alabama and not Houston  Texas.  The movie gets its point across and to the general audience it does exactly what it is meant to: entertain. If you are looking for a factual account of what happened to the city of Houston in June of 2001 then you will be disappointed. One thing to keep in mind before viewing this movie is that it is based solely on the evacuation of Memorial Hermann Hospital and not on Tropical Storm Alison and the impact on Houston metro itself. If you are looking for a factual account of Tropical Storm Alison's impact on Houston metro might I suggest watching The Weather Channel's Storm Stories for Tropical Storm Alison.  *1/2 out of *****\n",

A professional killer  Dennis Hopper  hired by mafia  is stalking her to prepare for the hit  but eventually he falls for her. Then  as a parody of the Stockholm Syndrome that defines a case when an abducted hostage begins to like and cooperate with the kidnapper  Jodie Foster falls for her abductor too  make love  and both prepare for a getaway.  Denis Hopper  the actor  tries to align himself with the creative ambitions of Dennis Hopper  the director. The result is disappointing  and fails to keep pace with the artistic level of a great performer as Dennis Hopper is. There is no real thrill and the script is sometimes naive and predictable. The film is saved to some extent by the performance of Jodie Foster who is not at her best  but still shines with her talent  beauty and gift. Of historical interest is the short appearance of Vincent Price  and  in a small act  of Charlie Sawn known from his great part in Wall Street.  If you decide to spend the 116 minutes to see the film  it is not a complete loss; this movie offers easy entertainment  but we would expect much more from the director of Easy Rider  and the actress who gave us the character of Sarah Tobias in The Accused.\n",

It's not even an euro-teen movie like the German Anatomy  much better  just a compilation of scenes that barely seems to have any relation one with the other and features LOTS of plot holes. The whole Celtic aspect is barely touched.

I decided to watch this with an open mind  knowing it was on the bottom 100.  Bad idea. I usually love crude humor  or can at least tolerate it. I love so-called black comedies.

I laughed a few times (for example  when the main character got stuck in the airplane toilet)  but that was it and didn't compensate for the strong disgust I felt.  I didn't laugh when the dog got sucked into a jet engine. I usually can't see the humor in animals dying (except in Animal House). I didn't laugh at much else of the nastiness  either. I turned it off after an incident involving a blind man and a baked potato that I don't care to repeat the details of  only that the wave of nausea still hasn't passed over me.

      "Definitely not your typical Polizia  Redneck just never worked for me. The movie tells the story of a jewel heist gone wrong and a young boy who is inadvertently kidnapped in the process. In their attempt to get away  the robbers leave a bloody trail of death in their wake as they hatch a plan to ransom the boy. The plan is never carried off as the robbers are more intent on getting to France and the boy is intent on staying with them. While I could cite a number of problems I had with the movie  I'll focus on the most obvious  the character Memphis played by Telly Savalas. From his work in The Dirty Dozen and Kelley's Heroes to other Italian films like Crime Boss to his most remembered role as Kojak  Savalas was a winner. I've always thought of him as one uber-cool customer. Unfortunately  Savalas is almost unwatchable in Redneck. Did the director turn on the camera and instruct him to act as psychotic as possible? It might not have been too bad had his actions been done within the context of a plot I cared about  but here he seems to be acting bizarre for sake of being bizarre. It's appears to be random lunacy. And what's with that accent? Savalas might have been a lot of things  but Southern isn't one of them. He sounds completely ridiculous even attempting the accent. Beyond that  I found little of interest in the rest of the movie. As I indicated  the plot never drew me in. I just didn't care about what was going on. And the notion that the boy is so quickly attracted to the criminal lifestyle doesn't ring true. As for the other actors  Mark Lester is almost as bad as Savalas and the usually reliable Franco Nero isn't a whole lot better. Three name actors and not a good performance between them. To make matters worse  I believe the director filmed many of the night scenes with nothing more than the glow from his watch to light the shots. I couldn't tell what was going on. Characters I hate  a plot I don't care about  and a production values that failed  little wonder I've given Redneck a 3/10.\n",

      "This sequel to the above - and the final entry in the Kharis series - is slightly more enjoyable on the whole but it's also more contrived (hell  we even get a singing barmaid/hostess!): Peter Coe is easily the least charismatic of the various Egyptian high priests we've seen during the course of these films  and Martin Kosleck as his henchman seems uninterested in the proceedings; Kurt Katch  then  is saddled with a ridiculous accent as the man who discovers the newly reincarnated Princess Ananka: the latter  in the form of Virginia Christine (later a much-used character actress) gets her most substantial 'role' and  indeed  the sequence of her resurrection from the swamps is a highlight not only of this film but the entire series. Unfortunately  here too  Chaney has precious little to do as once again the emphasis is on Ananka  as I've said; his Mummy (to which he returned most often at Universal - apart  naturally  from his signature role of The Wolf Man!) remains  without a doubt  his least memorable monster for the studio.\n",

      "Man  is this lousy. It doesn't deserve much in the way of comment so  keeping it brief  Rebecca DeMornay is a highly disciplined police psychiatrist who falls for Latin Lover Antonio Banderas in a wine store  he of the ponytail and jail-house tats. When she cuts loose  she really cuts loose. Other than this torrid affair she's having (and we must admit the affair has its speed bumps) she's a pretty cold fish. Her broke  ailing father shows up for the first time in years and she boots him out. She's also adept at keeping her horny upstairs neighbor (Dennis Miller) at bay. And there's prisoner Harry Dean Stanton who's trying to maneuver her into giving him a diagnosis of multiple personality disorder so he won't have his privates nailed to the wall for the serial murders he's committed.  All these people  and perhaps more  are immediately suspect when strange things begin happening to her. Somebody sends her dead flowers. Somebody does unspeakable things to her pet cat. (The next time I see a household pet turn up in a parcel or strung up in the closet or boiled in a pot  I'm going to puke.) So who's doing it? Guess. No power on earth could force me to reveal the ending  but maybe a hint will help: childhood abuse.  The abuse excuse is an interesting business in itself  far more interesting than the movie. What does childhood abuse mean? Do we mean sexual abuse? Physical? Both? How about whacking a kid over the back with a wooden cooking spoon  hard enough to break it? That's what happened to me and my brother when we were kids  just as similar things happened to all the other errant boys in the neighborhood. Sexual abuse? That never happened to any of us  as far as I know  although I'm not sure it would have been rejected with any degree of animation. In the Samoan village I studied for two years  there was one case of an adolescent boy found playing sexually with a much younger girl. The girl's family beat hell out of him. The boy's own family sent him to live with another branch of the family in another village  an exile that lasted two years. By the time he returned the incident was forgotten by everyone  including the child. (By the way  the little girl we see here is under five so it's unlikely that she'd remember Dad's night-time visits in any case since long-term memory isn't really established until about that time.) DeMornay's experience leading to her mental disorder can be called the social construction of trauma. It's not there unless we put it there. Enough of the psychiatric lecture. That will be fifteen cents.  You want trauma? I'll give you trauma. The film absolutely forces us to identify with Rebecca DeMornay's character  right from the beginning. Then  when she has her first tryst with Antonio Banderas  and Pio Donnagio's score is pounding the eroticism into our heads  the camera gives us a shot from over her shoulder of the bare-torsoed Antonio crawling over us with his hairy chest. Now THAT'S traumatic. It makes any male viewer feel as if he's on the floor of the laundry room at the California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo. Don't get me wrong. I don't dislike Antonio Banderas. It's just that I'm not in love with him. There aren't enough nude shots of Rebecca DeMornay's elfin body in the entire universe to compensate for that kind of anxiety.  Here's an engaging way of surviving this movie. Instead of just sitting there puling  try picking out the scenes that were filmed in Toronto and separating them from the ones shot in Budapest. It's a challenge  really  and may  for all we know  preserve your sanity.\n",

      "Admittedly  the only reason I watched this film -- since it's been about a decade since it was released -- was because of Ian Holm; I was intrigued to see his portrayal of my second-favorite character in this play. At any rate  this film is as gritty as anything the Old Zeff has produced since Jesus of Nazareth. But some of the best parts of the play have been left out. I understand the directing/editing choices  but I don't think that it really does justice to the play. Perhaps I'm too much a purist. I would have to direct people (who have read this far) toward Branagh's version  if it weren't that I despise his tendency toward over-dramatization. All the same  he plays a better Hamlet than Gibson. But then  weren't we all waiting for Gibson to prove himself as an actor? Now  all he's done is to prove that he wants to make films in extinct languages.  ...Perhaps the only Shakespearean-worthy acting here is Scofield as The Ghost.\n",

      "I was pulled into this movie early on  much to my surprise  because I hadn't intended to watch it at all. Now I wish I hadn't. The suspense starts out well  with the hit-and-run resulting in death and the question of whether the guilty character will confess  or be found out  or (doable now  though a no-no in the old days of movie-making) get away with it. The plot's been done before--what plot hasn't--but the tensions inherent in it  with the additional complications and motivations arising out of the illicit love affair  make for an absorbing first half. Then the film abandons the hit-and-run to embark upon a misty exposition of two unrequited  all-suffering loves. The two tracks of plot--hit-and-run and unreasoning love--just don't have enough to do with each other  and that they involve the same characters doesn't bind them enough to justify the departure from the original story line. The screenwriter should have chosen one plot or the other. At the end of the film  in the midst of the movie's second funeral  I found myself thinking  Now  what does any of this have to do with that hit-and-run? The filmmakers may think the answer obvious  but I think the movie was plotted and executed flabbily.\n",

There is nothing new about this film at all.   the bad guys seem to die with a couple of slashes no matter how many times our hero has been stabbed with a big sword he keeps on going looking the same (ish)!

This leaves me feeling conned yet again.  I admire them for attempting to tackle a dark storyline without the normal Hollywood cheese but I'm sorry to say the filmmakers have failed miserably.

      "I watched the unrated version of this movie and as a person who has studied the life and crimes of Speck closely  I must say this movie is a flawed but ambitious take on the real story. While capturing the true horror of Speck and the murders this film makes the following factual errors. 1. Speck did not inject drugs at the crime scene as depicted in the movie. In fact he was mainly an alcoholic and pill popper who rarely took drugs via syringe. 2. The Asian nurse who survived Speck's massacre did not squirm her way down stairs and under the couch in the living room as depicted in the movie. This would have been impossible. In real life she hid under a bed while Speck methodically eliminated his 8 victims. 3. The movie depicts Speck as being violent and brutal with the women as soon as he meets them. Not true. In reality Speck was at first calm and gentle  reassuring the women he wasn't going to hurt them. This is how he was able to tie each of them up. 4. The real Richard Speck was not the deep thinker the movie depicts him to be. FBI profiler Robert Ressler interviewed Speck in the 80's and said that Speck not only DID'NT know why he committed the murders but that he wasn't interested in learning why nor could he shed any light on why. Speck was known to be of below average intelligence and not the philosopher king who narrates this movie. If the story wasn't so tragic and horrifying  the voice over would be laughable. All in all  Doug Cole's performance is adequately menacing and cold-blooded even though I don't think the real Speck was so forward in his violence. No doubt he was a very violent person when under the influence but he was also known  after all  for being a fairly slick con man who was able to put people at ease before victimizing them. Beverly Ann Sotelo's performance as the surviving nurse is the finest in the film. She is a very good actress. If you are at all squeamish  do not see this film. It's very graphic and disturbing.\n",

      "Taylor Deemer Mrs. Drake English 10 PIB B4 31 March 2010   A Shot in the Dark  It is difficult to make it through the movie Heart of Darkness because it is incredibly unexciting. The book that this movie is based off of has little action to begin with. So the thought of turning it into a movie seems like a totally off-handed idea anyways  basically guaranteeing a fail.   Most of the book is of the mental travel of a young seaman named Marlow on a job through the many darknesses of the Congo and people as a whole",
      "I feel like the screenwriter failed massively at capturing the essence of Marlow's travels. It totally missed the biggest issue of light versus dark. That is the major point in the book and when that doesn't translate to the movie  all that's left is 100 minutes of boredom and monotony.   This being the case  the question is posed  why would anyone make this into a movie? An even better question could then be asked  who would want to watch it? It is utterly a chore to watch. Had it not contributed to a grade in my English class  I would have never even considered watching the movie. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. Heart of Darkness is stripped of all its insight and meaning when it's taken from the pages of the book. The novella is torture to read until the last twenty pages or so  but the afterthought is that it is a pretty decent book. The movie is like a shot in the dark with no chance in the world of hitting its target.   How can a book that's all about the mental processes and realizations of darkness be portrayed in a physical  visual sense? I feel like it's impossible to accurately show thoughts. Also  I feel like the time difference between the book and the movie creates major points that don't seem to add up at all. The novella Heart of Darkness was published in 1902  while the movie version of Heart of Darkness is from 1993. The 91 years between the two may be a reason behind the seemingly different terrains. The novella seems to have much harsher conditions  and the movie does not portray the prehistoric feel of the Congo. The Congo  in the movie  just seems like another place  not the dark  inhuman place that the book paints this setting of. I feel like this removes another major element that really contributes to the novella.  With two of the biggest aspects of the storyline missing in the movie  the little bit of decency that is in the book Heart of Darkness is gone. When the controversy of light versus dark is the biggest theme  not including it in the movie makes it seem like the entire movie will be incredibly pointlessand it is. It's dull  unexciting  and a major waste of time. There's no reason to watch it. The book is stripped of any significance it has. If it's necessary  for some reason  read the book. Avoid the movie at all costs.

If I have to stop following the story to wonder what the heck is the black chick/drag queen doing there? then the storyteller has failed me. Again  not clever in my opinion but annoying and irritating  and very film school final project-ish. And for pete's sake if you are going to shoot in black and white at least use some of the techniques used in old films that take full advantage of not having color.

      "28 years before 9/11  there was another 9/11 which represented a key date in the history of Chile  South America and the whole world. This was the date in 1973 when a bloody coup in Chile deposed Salvador Allende the first Marxist president elected democratically anywhere in the world and put an end to the Chilean experiment of a democratic transition from capitalism to socialism. Allende committed suicide when the armed forces attacked the presidential palace.  Unfortunately this film is too biased and too nostalgic towards the time of Allende's rule to be an objective rendition of the man and of his place in history. The times were troubled and Allende was a disputed figure in the history of his country and of the whole world. True  he was democratically elected  but his policies plunged Chile into economic crisis. He was deposed by a coup and a right-wing dictatorship followed with repression and flagrant human rights abuses  but he was also an ally of Castro who saw in his policies another way of making revolution. We'll never know if his tentative to build a socialist yet democratic society would have succeeded. The authors of the movie take a completely pro-Allende position  there is no opinion or point of view trying to explain the other side  to answer questions like why did the middle class oppose him  or how his democratic views could go together with supporting or being supported by Castro. The tone of the commentaries is nostalgic and apologetic  almost propagandistic. People who want to get a better understanding of this episode of the history need to wait for a more balanced and objective film or book in the future.\n",

I don't know if this was straight to video  but it should have been straight to the dump.  Elijah Wood fans will like the fact that he appears shirtless in a much-too-brief shower scene. But  no sane person would like this script. Imagine Memento played by teen actors  but ten times more confusing and a hundred times less plausible. Case in point: Janeane Garofalo plays a caring psychologist (apparently `keeping the chain of mediocrity alive').  As if false memories syndromes and mind-over-matter medicine weren't hokey enough  the movie also hinges on one of those unexplained psychic twin bonds that keep the plot moving and the audience baffled. This same twin bond creates a few too many contrived love scenes between Wood's character and the girl from She's All That  who plays the saintly sister of Wood's angry cancer-victim friend.  Adding to the triteness of this screenplay  Wood's other friends are a mentally challenged cancer victim and Kidney  a young black boy afflicted with a mysterious kidney disease. Kidney's dying wish comes true when Dr. Garofalo gives him his own Walkman. This character's hackneyed function in the story is matched by his on-again  off-again relationship to walking. Usually bound to a wheelchair  Kidney has several inexplicable scenes showing him pushing others around in it.  Kindey's characterization may be one small detail  but it is indicative of this film's many other flaws. The Bumblebee Flies Anyway is definitely bumbling  but it never flies.\n",

      "All I can say is  this movie is made for the Lifetime Channel on TV  which means no solid characters  no particular style  weak acting all kinds of suggested sex but no-breasts and tushs (because boy  that would just catapult the film into the depths of sleaze wouldn't it?) but the heavily simulated sex  well  that's OK.   When watching these films I have to ask myself  when will these types of TV channels and their advertisers ever grow up? I think these companies are actually way behind the times. They really have no clue what the younger generation is in tune with and if they knew they would demand we change. The whole point of many American TV channels like these seems mostly to regurgitate the same sanitized  diluded garbage over and over like a generic movie assembly line. I guess it works for them... or at least it has. Not sure about the future though.   Don't bore yourself to death like I did. Seek out some real TV movies on HBO  Showtime  IFC  Starz  etc. Any channel that puts effort into their work and doesn't have to ask a priest what they can or cannot show.\n",

      "I would put Death Wish 3 in the same box as Stallone's Cobra and Commando. The box that I would sell for $2 at a garage sale with all the videos inside. The story is about the main character coming back from the previous movies' success to ruin it all with this load of trash. Why did the makers want to destroy the reputation of the past 2 films with this cheap junk. The story is so lame that had to be a outrageous sequel. I mentioned Cobra earlier because it has the same mood  that one man can kill 20 or 30 gang members without a scratch. Both this movie and Cobra were bent on showing the hero firing his guns at hip level and the enemy falling in large numbers. Police officers spend hours at the shooting range so why did they get gunned down by gang members firing aimlessly from their hips? This movie was so bad I thought for a minute it was Death Wish 4.\n",

      "Ants are shown in cartoons as being able to carry away chicken legs  watermellons  people  etc. This may be an admirable characteristic because ants carry the film Phase IV. This is not because they want to  but because they have to.  The movie opens with a narrator cryptically explaining that some cosmic event has come over the earth  and that a fellow scientist has been working on the effect this disturbance has on the ant population. The movie is broken up in segments; the first part after the cosmic event is Phase I  and so on until the end of the movie  which is Phase IV.  What is Phase IV? Who knows? We don't get to see that part; presumably it has something to do with the bonding of one of the scientists studying the ants and a girl who lived in the area. The girl  who looks like a cross between Alicia Silverstone and Liv Tyler  is mad at the ants because they killed her horse  but except for one angry outburst  goes around the biodome with a blank (Clueless?) look.  These ants are pretty smart; or the scientists are rather dumb. I'll give credit to the ants. Why? Anything that usually ruins my picnics that can then build reflecting towers  blow up trucks  and adapts to poison with the greatest of ease gets my vote for being the smarter species  at least in this movie.

      "Plodding  maybe that should have been the title. Bad dialogue delivered at a snail's pace. All the characters are single dimension with the exception of one. Unfortunately  that character has some of the worst lines and does not seem to fit into this cliché ridden two- hour drag. Having grown up in the seventies  this film is seriously lacking in detail  atmosphere and authenticity. Surprisingly  this was produced by Kelsey Grammar  someone who should recognize sharp dialogue and a consistent narrative in a script. Cameron Richardson is about the only element that lights up this film. Robin Trower's music is also a welcomed addition.\n",

      "Some people may remember Ms. Russell from films such as Black Widow  which had some appeal and critical acclaim. Boy  she must have really needed a rent check when she signed on to do this dog.  Yes  there will be those who like the gratuitous violence and nudity. But one must sit back and wonder  in retrospect  what possessed anyone to spend money and time to make this in the first place. I just saw this movie on one of the HBO's  and I can't believe they picked it up.  In 1996 Ms. Russel didn't have the physical attractiveness she did earlier in her career. But  come on! Having her play Ma Barker??? Her sons all look like they could be her brothers. It's also creepy in that you think there are going to be incestuous relationships occurring (thank goodness there aren't  hope that doesn't count as a spoiler). With Eric Roberts and Alyssa Milano added into the cast  this one is B-movie 'straight to video' all the way.  The scenes between Purvis and Ma Barker  either in person or on the phone  are a primer in terrible  terrible acting. Oh  wait  I forgot terrible  terrible writing as well.

      "Wow  was this version of THE RACKETEER tough to watch! While none of the other reviews have mentioned this  the public domain version I watched was seriously flawed. The sound track was off by about 10 seconds--meaning the dialog and action never came close to matching. So  you'd hear something occur well before you saw it--a very confusing proposition! The worst is where you hear a gun shot and only later doe the guy get hit and slump to his death in a taxi.  While this seriously marred the film  it also made concentrating on the dialog easier--and showed the serious shortcomings of it as well. The dialog was simply awful--often delivered with almost no inflection or feeling. As one review said  it was like watching a high school play. Part of this is understandable  as sound was a new medium  but this film's dialog was bad even compared to other 1929 films--really bad. And  like many of these early sound films  the film was just too talky--with sappy and overly melodramatic language and just not much action. And you'd THINK with a title like The Racketeer that there would be some action!! However  it's really a sappy romance--with very little action.  The film finds Carol Lombard straddled with an alcoholic musician. She herself ends up stealing to try to take care of him--and the crook  Robert Armstrong  comes to her assistance. When Armstrong catches her cheating at cards  he covers for her and then helps the drunk brother to get on his feet--and naturally he falls for her in the process. The problem is that once the drunk sobers up  he  too  wants Lombard and she needs to choose between them. Wow...a recovering drunk or a mobster...talk about a couple great prospects! Overall  it's a bit hard to rate considering the lousy print I saw. However  even if you ignore this  the film has a lot of problems due to its poor use of dialog and excessively talky nature. And...it was sappy too boot.\n",

He looks like an old retarded retired reject cop... I am a cop and I can tell.. the man can't act... go back to being a cop..no screen presence.. why did they show his bare ass so  as if he is Mel Gibson   hell no... put the filmmaker out of business.. this guy has no business making a movie... I seriously doubt women or gay men find him attractive... whoever cast the film is a no talent hack who cast no talent hacks in the lead.. it's great that us white guys are alway getting the Asian women but why an ugly white guy why not Dean Cain or Brad Pitt as the white boyfriend.. why to Asian women like ugly white guys or black guys in what I see??? Don't get it.. must be low self esteem..  The only hot girl who can act in the movie was the Kate Holliday..why was there one hot white chick among all the rest of the ugly Asian chicks who think they are hot and can act???  Only two actors in this movie the Host of the Poetry at the end of the movie and the one hot white chick in the massage house.. TL Young and Kate Holliday should have been the leads in the movie..  The Asia Character was ridiculous looked like she was trying too hard to be some kind of ghetto/sexy black girl...key word here is trying..  Gina.. you can't act and you are not hot enough physically for this kind of role.. you need to play character roles and be more humble in your self presentation..  I think the actress is Gina Hirazumi... I looked her up on the IMDb and she is a great Asian Actress???? if that is the case I don't want to see what the bad Asian American actresses are..  . No wonder Hollywood doesn't have Asian American Actors!!! if this is the best they got!!! they were supposedly winning some kind of Asian film award?? give me break...it looked like they just made a movie for the sake of putting a bunch of Asian girls in them.. they aren't even hot..Gina...you are not hot.. stop trying..play character roles and improve your acting..you are not a leading female type...  If this movies makes money pigs can fly..sorry for being so blunt but I feel that these actors/ actresses need to either get better or work on their craft: for the exception of the two actors I mentioned who should have played the leads.. I say this in love for all the Asian lead girls in the film please do what your parents say and go and be doctors/lawyers/and engineers...and do acting on the side for fun..hopefully that is what you are doing now.. I am not trying to be mean but hoping this will be read and push you people to either get better or go do another business.. there was not even a message ethically in this movie..  I would not be surprised if Soap Girls was secretly funded by members of the Ku Klux Klan special department of Asian American hate propaganda of the Klan  .. Otherwise Asian people must hate themselves..seeing this film makes me as the viewer grateful that I am not Asian..you folks are pathetic..have some self respect you Asian people.\n",

      "Alright! A sci-fi/horror/action B-hybrid directed by Jim Wynorski and in the final scenes we get to see a cyborg with a defleshed metal head killing off multiple people! As with any Wynorski-flick  he throws in a whole bunch of crazy ideas and subplots that mostly don't lead to anywhere. But Storm Trooper is more like a two-movies-for-the-price-of-one kind of deal. On the one hand we got the drama/thriller part (as such the film opens) with Carol Alt killing her incredibly annoying & ungrateful husband (a plot that simply leads to nowhere). And on the other hand we got the 'escaped cyborg on a rampage' part  Night of the Living Dead-style. With Carol and the Cyborg being the ones trapped inside the house and a bunch of special OPs/bounty hunters playing the role of the zombies  trying to break into the house. Needless to say this flick is not up there with the greatest. Zach Galligan (of Gremlins-fame) especially is painfully bad and Corey Feldman (in a small supporting roll) is once again completely wasted on this movie. Wynorski even rips off one of his own movies here  since I am 99% sure he used some stock footage of his previous film 976 EVIL II (the scene with the exploding truck and the motorcycle). Yes  it's so not good and so much fun. This is strictly for Wynorski-fans only. And I am one of them  in case you didn't know already.\n",

      "Hello it is I Derrick Cannon and I welcome you to the first ever Cannonite review show. My movie for this week was debatable  what route what movie  what excellent four star epic would I choose  guess what I decided to pull a one eighty and go the other route  I've decided to review a movie so atrocious that it totally killed what could have been a very unique concept. The movie I will review today is Jack Frost Two revenge of the mutant killer snowman. The Stars in this movie include Christopher Allport as Sam Tiller  Eileen Seeley as Anne Tiller  Marsha Clark as Marla David Allen Brooks as Agent Manners  Sean Patrick Murphy as Captain Fun  Ray Cooney as the Colonel and Scott MacDonald as the killer snowman himself Jack Frost.  It's hard to believe that this movie was in the same series that gave us the incredibly funny Jack Frost(loved the carrot scene) but it's even harder to believe that this is the exact same cast. The movie was ruined for me as soon as they arrived on the island and Captain Fun was introduced. What was the point of his character and how did he fit into a horror movie?The only possible reason I could see was that they wanted to give us a character that was total killer snowman fodder. Sam Tiler seemed more paranoid then he did in the original  his babbling about anti freeze was one of the most pathetic display I had seen in a movie. His wife however was one of the few bright spots. She played her role as the main woman to a hilt. She was a voice of reason in film of pure idiocy. The scene where she figures out how to kill the snowmen was one of the most anticipated parts of the movie. Ray MacDonald once again did a great job as Jack Frost despite what he was given. If it wasn't for such weak characters he could have been immortalized like Chucky Freddy and Jason. Laugh if you must but when it comes down to it Jack Frost had spunk  he had humor  and most importantly he had an undoubtable vicious streak.  This movie could have been so much more  it could have been a continuation of a great franchise  instead any plans to make a Jack Frost three have been canceled.  This movie gets a two out of ten for me  and it's lucky that it even gets a one.\n",

      "Here is another great film critics will love. The problem is that it is not a very good movie.  The films premise is simple. Nine convicts escape a prison after the tenth one goes crazy and tells them where the treasure is.  The first half has a lot of slapstick some of it very broad while the second half is a character driven descent into fantasy and melancholy.  The two halves simply don't mix. Individual scenes do work very well (The guys crashing a friends house who has a new Filipino bride is hilarious While a later scene with the big guy working in the restaurant tugs at the heartstrings.) They simply don't mesh with each other.  The movie as well is missing entire set-ups. One scene shows the guys desperately looking for change under a deserted vending machine to buy a snack. The very next scene has the whole crew in drag sitting down in a restaurant. Where did they get the dresses and wigs? (The crew includes both the big guy and a midget) How did they get all the clothes and money to buy the meal? And most puzzling is why are they in drag? They are clearly guys in drag and lets face it is there anything more memorable to witnesses than a big guy and a dwarf eating a meal dressed as women? I mention the big guy and the dwarf because besides the old guy everyone else seems to blend into each other. (In fact they wear matching white jumpsuits throughout most of the movie) The movie has very little character development in the first half and as a result the second half really lacks an emotional punch. As we are often trying to figure out who is who in their individual payoff scenes.  Speaking of a drag the second half has all those wonderful sweeping camera shots and big emotional moments and great symbolism that makes a great film. It is also excruciatingly slow which makes for a boring movie.  9 Souls is a big disappointment  the reviews gush about a great film and it's in there somewhere  good luck finding it yourself.\n",

      "Not since 8 Heads in a Duffel Bag and the How High previews  have I laughed so little at something that the film makers thought  would be hysterical.  Jerry Lewis is the richest man in the world. He is rejected as 4-F  by the army  and decides to use his money to raise his own army-  of about half a dozen. He then impersonates a Nazi commander in  Italy  and eventually tries to kill Hitler. That is the description of the  flimsy plot.  This film is as funny as a heart attack. This film makes Hogan's  Heroes look like Shakespeare. If the money men of The  Producers had really wanted to lose their cash  they should have  shown this film. I cannot stress how bad this thing is.  Lewis' direction consists of two different cameras shooting the  action from two different angles  then being edited together. This  sitcom type of direction works on television  but here it is an  obvious attempt to cheat the audience. He ends most of his  scenes with a still shot  as if giving the viewer a chance to double  over in stitches before going to the next tired set up. I spent most of  the movie doubled over in abdominal agony  accompanied with  severe flatulence  over this thing.  Lewis  the director and producer  sets the film in 1943  but makes  no attempt to use period costumes or sets. Everyone wears the  latest style and has the latest interior design...for 1970. The  supporting cast is lost as Lewis goes off on his patented tangents   which last as long as major surgery and are just as painful to  watch. When Lewis becomes the Nazi commander  he spends the  last half of the film screaming at the top of his lungs in a  performance so odious as to stink up any good will you try to bring  in at the beginning.  The final embarassing shot has Lewis and his cronies trying to  put one over on the Japanese. They wear buck teeth  squint their  eyes  and talk in a funny accent. It may be one of the most  blatantly racist occurrences since the internment camps. I was  slack jawed at what Lewis did through this whole thing  but that put  me over the edge. Watch for Kaye Ballard's very tasteless scene  where she tries to attempt suicide over and over again.  Star Trek's George Takei has two small scenes  then wisely  drops out of the picture. This has less laughs than Mel Brooks' last  three films combined. There is nothing sadder than watching a  formerly respected comedian screw up a project so horribly  you  actually feel ashamed for them. Jim Carrey learned that with The  Majestic  but Jerry Lewis still shows up on television once in a  while pulling the same unfunny schtick. I feel sorry for him.  Which Way to the Front? is cheap  unfunny  offensive  and stupid.  I feel bad for everyone involved  and anyone who must endure this.  I do not recommend it.  Though rated (G)  this contains some physical violence  some gun  violence  and some adult situations. If your child shows interest in  seeing this  please consult professional help.  \n",

      "The worst part about this film is that it did not have to be so terrible.  They had a nice budget  though so do many films; they made it look slick and pretty  and best of all they had the 21st century lesbian-savvy audiences who would embrace a lesbian positive film... and yet the writer and director went out of their way to lift every single redone film bit about lesbian torment and confusion at boarding schools  (you know  the place all lesbian love lives and dies).   This is a theme that has been done again and again and AGAIN in film  but something that viewers-if one uses this voting forum as a clue- cannot seem to get enough of.  Every element of this story was so over the top  excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through. The lead characters say it all: the crazy  abandoned  genius  rebel lesbian tough girl (well  they took a super pretty femme like Piper Perabo and tried to rough her up  but it didn't stick much) seduces pretty rich girl who is destined to betray her.   Watching them every step of the way is character 3  a dopey  well-meaning  wide-eyed  good girl observer. I say 'every step' because she shares her every thought with the audience via the stiffest  most inane monologues.  Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old  though they are trying oh so  so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really  um  you know  well... talk. Hearing them (make love) with their noises was um  you know  like  well... okay! she says about her 2 wanton roommates  who roll around in the bed next to her.  Later she asks Graham Greene- the accomplished native American actor who is completely wasted in a roll as a gardener (!) Is it wrong to care what people think?  Sorry  but is she a teenager  or is she age 7?  Granted  Piper Perabo (as Polly the tortured dyke) & others do an okay job for the horrible lines they are forced to utter. Perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera. She would do well in a decent project  so this is in no way a criticism of the acting.  But this story is SHAMELESS in perpetuating every single stereotype about lesbians all rolled into one character. They couldn't stop with her (Polly) being an angry  crazy-passionate  secret genius who finished math problems for the speechless teacher. Oh but that's after she argues with the teacher who dares accuse her of gabbing.  That's a word THEY (males) use against US (women)! she says  stomping out of the classroom.  Is this ALL the writer could come up with? Or maybe we should ask: Why stop there?   Poole and co. went on and made Polly a poetic dark child who communicates with wild hawks by screaming their name in the woods.  Cue the slow motion  sci-fi  Xena atmosphere!  Then we have her writing to her birth mother... (most lesbians are love-starved orphans  in case you were in the dark).  Then we have two teachers (one uptight  one a zany type with loose neck ties) who hover around all of the action (the school looks awfully big for just 2 teachers)... and give dark child/ seductress/bird girl tense looks. Hmmmm. I wonder if something well  you know... um  FUNNY is happening between these TWO TEACHERS??????  There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done. Heartbreak happens  but surely the writer and director know that lesbians exist in much more sophisticated times than this schlock.  I cannot reveal the ending out of respect to those who force themselves to sit through til the end  but if you are not laughing  I can only guess you are crying. And not for the right reason. And I don't mean the wimpy make out scenes.\n",

      "Have seen this movie today. Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist. The most sad things are:  1. It's very slow.   2. How Ghengis-khan  cruel and mighty emperor of Asia can be played by a kind  good actor with warm and lovely eyes - during all the movie except one scene?   3. Lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age. We see an ex-slave without money  power  friends or home. Click! - the very next second he's leading the huge army  without any reasons to be a leader.   4. The magic of Ghengis-khan arise is kindly explained only by the help of one wolf/god/whoever it was.   5. Can a man make love to his wife THAT way after not seeing her for years?   6. Is it enough to win the sword fight if you just riding your horse through the enemy lines  sitting there with two swords and everybody around you dies? Does Ridley Scott know that way?   7. Why after 20-30 years Khan's mother doesn't look older?   8. What is the motivation for the main character? (None. Literally.)  Don't waste your time. Really. Cinematographers's work is good; the nature is outstanding - but the movie cannot be made without director and script. The real Ghengis-khan would execute director in a second.  Kind regards.\n",

All is in the cliché of the mentor and the talented immature pupil. The characters aren't' even interesting nor sympathetic. Artistically it is as empty and insignificant. The colours are very impersonal and light. Only the poster may be appealing. Al Pacino tries very hard to give depth to his character with no success. Too bad because the sport betting can be a really interesting subject to which many could relate. But I can't have a complete comment on this movie any way as i got out from the theatre 20 minutes before ending. Everything was so predictable that it was a waist of time...\n",

The story is believable as if your been to bars in the outs of the south you would know. But here comes this piece of junk Roadhouse 2 Last Call. Lets just hope they are serious with the title and never make another Roadhouse ever again.It doesn't have the charm of the characters of the original nor is the story really believable. The Story is more of a Steven Segal type action that even though Roadhouse 2 is a B movie it still doesn't click as some B movie action still sales the movie no matter how cheesy it is. The only reason to rent not buy this movie is that we finally find out the one question is left from the original Roadhouse. Patrick Swayze's character Dalton  is Dalton his first name or last name? Well I'll save you the $4.00 rental fee. Dalton is his first name as in Dalton Tanner. NEVER MAKE ANOTHER ROADHOUSE!!!!!!!!!!!\n",

      "Got to confess right up front that I didn't watch this entire movie. I missed the first hour during a Sci Fi Channel broadcast. Or was I spared the first hour? The other reviewers sum this one up nicely. It was badly conceived. Badly scripted. Badly acted.  But the worst thing for me was the ADR. The entire film  which appeared to have been dubbed  sounded like it was done in somebody's garage. There was a voluminous echo to the words  which just served to make the bad dialog hang. And hang. And hang. Even a made for TV movie should have recognized this.  And the idea that alternate dimensions are differentiated by color saturation went out in the 80s  folks.\n",

      "I find it difficult to comprehend what makes viewer's feel this is a powerful movie. I would guess that the main intention of this film would be a character study and the effects of racism in a British community. It is therefore all the more disappointing that all the characters are two dimensional and the acting is at the level of a college performing arts course. I'm always sceptical of improvisation  another word for being too lazy to write a decent script. I was embarrassed by the performances and sat in an audience who laughed when they surely were supposed to be moved by the story. Racism is a serious issue but I think a subtle approach in cinema works far better than laying it on with trowel.\n",

      "If you decide to watch Wild Rebels  don't expect anything deep and meaningful. If you're looking for a film that explores the relationships and structure of a motorcycle gang  Wild Rebels is the wrong movie. If you're looking for an expose on the breakdown of the American educational system and the problem of juvenile delinquency  Wild Rebels is the wrong movie. If you're looking for a movie that examines how undermanned rural police departments are when facing a well-financed  well-organized gang  Wild Rebels is the wrong movie. But if you're looking for an absurd movie filled with scene after scene of unintentional humor  horrendous acting  a paper-thin plot  and community theater style production values  Wild Rebels is the right movie.  Wild Rebels is the story of a down-on-his-luck stock-car driver named Rod Tillman (Steve Alaimo). After a fiery crash (which Rod walks away from completely unscathed despite having only a cotton pants and a London Fog style jacket for protection)  Rod decides to give it up. With no plan for his future other than to wander aimless through the back-roads of the South  he stumbles on the Satan's Angels motorcycle gang (a gang being three of the stupidest guys to ever zip up a leather jacket and a woman they seem to share). This group of hoodlums spends their time terrorizing a rural town in Florida by committing such atrocities as stealing a newspaper from a neighbor's mailbox. These bumbling idiots need someone to act as their driver during some larger crimes they have planned. Apparently  these three Einsteins can only drive vehicles with two tires  not four. So they recruit Rod to perform feats of daring that only an experienced stunt driver would be capable of like keeping the car in the middle of a gravel road during a low-speed chase. Eventually  they hold-up a bank  get into the aforementioned low-speed chase  and have the lamest gun battle with the police ever put on film. I could go on forever  but you get the idea.  I hate the term so bad it's good  but that seems to aptly describe Wild Rebels.\n",

      "and it's only January  still I'm sure of it!  By far this is among the worst Swedish movies I've ever seen and to be honest Swedish movies ain't that good in general. It have been claimed to be original and perhaps it can be seen as that for people who never seen a English speaking movie  for us who have been to the cinema the last 10 years it can't help but to feel like Måns Mårlind and Björn Stein have been sitting down one weekend going through the most successful movies from the last years and tried to squeeze it all together in to one Swedish package. What can I say the outcome can just be...poor. First of all the story is just weak to begin with  even worse when it's not just a poor story it's a wish to combine to very poor stories - first a failed try to make Swedish action á la Matrix and then combine it with a really bad moral story. And if you thought it could not be worse you'll notice all the cool stuff that just have been thrown in there for absolutely no reason at all more than in a bad way trying to show that Sweden also can do Hollywood movies - which we can't nor should try to. For example the main plot is tried to made deeper by letting youths play a computer game called Storm having absolutely nothing at all with the story or for example how there is a internet side about Storm while all the sudden it just is the main characters consciousness - really I don't think even Stein or Mårlind can see a point with three quarters of the movie  more than just trying to show off poor extra effects. For the actors  I've got to admit Eric Ericson does a pretty good job except he does the same job the whole movie through  even tough Storm tries to be a movie about the personal development of DD he does not change one bit in his way of acting. Jonas Karlsson  well to be honest I thought he was a fairly respected actor but judging by Storm... really he just have to be ashamed of this movie  his character and his scar. Lastly Eva Röse is just beyond critic  both her character and her acting. The only reasons Storm succeeds of not getting a 1/10 is for Eric Ericson and  what can I say  at least it tries..\n",

Iron Eagle II has a senseless plot and can be used to as a cure to insomnia. I didn't even bother to watch Iron Eagle III  but from looking at the R rating  I assume it's more violent than the past 2 movies. Well  Iron Eagle IV is probably the most inane sequel. Lou Gossett Jr. returns as the always delightful Chappy Sinclair. Another Jason returns to fill the role of Doug Masters (Canadian Jason Cadieux  who looks just like Jason Gedrick from the first Iron Eagle). But wait(Here comes a possible spoiler).....Wasn't Doug killed in Iron Eagle II? The writers must've been desprate for a story so they revived Doug Masters by saying he was a prisoner of the Russians. This movie was the cheapest done of all the Iron Eagle films. Why do movie makers find it neccessary to make sequels to unappealing movies? (ex. Police Academy movies). I have always liked Gossett Jr.'s work in these films. He was the only one holding this turkey together. Let's hope this was the last of the Iron Eagle sequels. let it rest in peace.\n",

The French cinema seems to have lost its footing these days and this is a good example of how a motley script can waste brilliant actors. While some may find the 'playfulness' of the script to be in line with the dictates of Euro post modernism  the whole project seems more like a post-mortem on the death of Euro-cinema's golden years and truly fabulous talents --- one is vaguely reminded here of Bunuel but without the charm or wit.\n",

      "1989 was already a year in where Eddie Murphy wasn't that longer hot and started making movies that soon would be forgotten. Funnily enough  it was also the year in where Murphy directed his first film  but it also would be the first and last experiment. Harlem nights wasn't exactly what you can call a success even if it was great to see the two best black comedians together namely Murphy and Richard Pryor. Don't blame it on the actors as they all played their roles like you expected them do  even if you have to face (again) the typical Murphy-laugh. The worst thing from Harlem nights are both the scenario and its terrible decors. Everything is set in the roaring twenties and everybody has their profit from the forbidden clubs. Sugar Ray (Pryor) and his adopted son Quickie (Murphy) are gathering easily 10000 dollar per day but of course soon the mob and the corrupt police come around the corner to claim their part of the cookie. Sugar and Quickie aren't guys who give their money for free and have their own plans. You can watch Harlem Nights that's for sure  but if you puke from the moment you hear the name Murphy you better avoid as after all this movie is nothing but a lame excuse to see some good jokes.\n",

      "This is realism? If Rivette was seeking to give us a ground-level study of a woman in a certain place and time and how she was able to influence (and was influenced by) the world around her  he has failed miserably. Most prominently because we never get a clue as to why thousands of men would have followed her into battle. There is certainly not enough exposition of the cultural/historical context to define the country's need for such a savior and  god knows  there is nothing particularly charismatic about Joan as she is presented here. Unless Bonnaire's wooden posturing and flat line readings are supposed to indicate transcendent faith and determination. The use of landscape is particularly uninspired - we never lose the feeling we are watching twentieth century actors wandering in a supposedly medieval landscape. And as for the battle scenes (which  in contrast to some commentors claims  do take up a good 15% of screentime)- they look like look like some some History Club from your local high school recreating a medieval siege  although the kids would no doubt put more passion into it. I will give Rivette credit  however  for picturing a side of Joan left out by other movies: that of a petulant  naive  and narcissistic adolescent (played by a woman all too clearly at least twice the age of the character she is supposed to portray) obviously unable to understand her place within the movement she is helping to create or the world existing outside her own passions. Joan's outrage at her own soldiers swearing and astonishment at the enemy for their lack of respect and obedience to her are jarringly spontaneous and believable notes (you suddenly realize such moments must naturally have occurred)in an otherwise uninvolving historical representation. Unfortunately they also serve to point out precisely what is not addressed on screen -what made Joan SPECIAL? I must say I also continued to be puzzled and frustrated by certain foreign film lovers who equate tedium and lack of dramatic involvement with artistry and seriousness. Does this film really increase our understanding or involvement with the subject? Or with anything for that matter? 4/10.\n",

      "I watched this movie on video the other night and found myself dozing off throughout this uninspired snoozefest. First of all  one of my biggest pet peeves is when movies like this are characterized as horror movies. It is a THRILLER! get it right!It has no monsters or anything supernatural. It is simply a movie about a twisted serial killer (Actually there is a very small body count so it is more of a serial torturer movie and it did a good job of torturing me.) The basic premise of a man luring teenagers to his house of horrors through online chat rooms could have made for a great movie but we only see him lure one pair of teen girls through the internet at the very beginning of the film. One of these girls turns out to be a local detective's daughter and he gets emotionally involved in the case. The film quickly changes from a potentially intelligent sado-masochistic thriller to a boring old cat and mouse game between the incredibly dull detective and the psychopathic Captain Howdy/Carleton Hendricks played adequately by writer/producer/Twisted Sister frontman  Dee Snider. The occasional attempts at meaningful poetic one-liners about the positive effects of pain and the like from Snider are laughable. If he is attempting to get people to subscribe to these opinions through this film  he fails miserably and (unintentionally) makes light of them. The directing by John Pieplow (whose only previous directing effort was Jurassic Women  which I will let the title speak for itself) was uninspired and there was something wrong with the editing which resulted in the film being disjointed with a few scenes completely unrelated to the plot  unless the screenplay is at fault (which is quite possible.) This film a completely unsuccessful attempt at a thriller trying to pass of as a horror movie that's only achievement was making me squirm at the sight of a few graphic bodily piercings. If you see it at your video store don't waste your money but if you need something to laugh at one night and Strangeland is on cable  you might as well watch. 3 out of 10\n",

I mean in what alternate universe did the filmmakers and studios think that this film would play? From beginning to end we bombarded with Quaids overacting and ridiculous facial expressions  laying on the im a loose cannon act a little thick. Another picking point I had with the movie was the lack of a realistic story of events that would make you grow to connect to a character. I mean in one scene where Lewis is playing in a bar before making it big there is this over the top  just completely absurd bar fight that every citizen in town is apparently a part of. Then Lewis begins to play his rendition of A whole lot of shaking' and everyone immediately forgets their differences and begins dancing wildly as if its the most normal thing in the world. These kind of scenes  of which there are numerous  coupled with the lack of depth in any of the characters led me to actual laughter.

      "A group of teenagers discover a bootleg video game  but once they start playing it  they each start dying just like they do in the video game. As they become addicted to the game  they need to find a way to beat the game's central villain  The Blood Countess  before she kills them all.  The premise does sound a little stupid and familiar but this film could have still been mildly entertaining. However  this horror movie is not scary at all. It's actually more of a comedy than anything else. The film takes itself way too seriously and the movie is not a lot of fun to watch. Sure  there is the occasional laugh but for the most part  the film is very dull. PG-13 horror films can still be good like The Ring or Cry Wolf. The Ring and Stay Alive aren't really the same type of horror film though. Stay Alive is more of a slasher movie and since its rated PG-13  the death scenes are very tame. It should have been the movie's main sell and since it had an interesting concept the deaths could have been really good. Unfortunately  the studio wanted a bigger audience and the film had to be altered.  The acting is a complete joke and most of the cast give awful performances. Jon Foster is not a very good leading man. He lacks charisma to really engage the audience or for the audience to care about him. His character isn't unlikable just very bland. Samaire Armstrong actually gives an okay performance though a little too bland to truly stick out. Frankie Muniz probably gives the best performance in Stay Alive. That's an honor on the level of being the best player on the Houston Texans. Sophia Bush is absolutely terrible as October. Her performance feels so rushed and so fake. The most annoying character in the movie is Phineas played by Jimmi Simpson. His character is so unlikable you will be rooting for him to die.  In fact  most of the characters are pretty unlikable so that makes it even harder to become interested in the film. It's just hard to feel sorry for some of these annoying kids and it's a lot more fun to watch if you want the characters to actually survive. The only real good thing about the movie is the atmosphere. It's a little old but it still kind of works. The film is also really short so it's not too much of a pain to sit through. I wouldn't really blame the cast though because they were working with an inexperience director and writer. The direction is not very good and the screenplay isn't much better. Stay Alive is actually not the worst horror film of 2006. That honor would go to When a Stranger Calls. Stay Alive is still a missed opportunity though. In the end  this cheesy and lame horror film is better left on the shelf. Rating 4/10.\n",

      "I'm not sure what the point of making this film was. It looked as if it was made by some historical society to be shown in your local 'Pistol Pete' museum. At first it appears that it could be the beginning of a Mad TV or SNL sketch. But then the joke is on you when there is no punchline and you realize that someone was taking this seriously. The story wasn't bad but the inclusion of the SASS members seemed to be a ploy (that worked) to get me to see the film. I swear  the trailer listed every character in the film down to dead cowboy #5. The reason Westerns are so fun is the atmosphere and the characters it brings. I just had the feeling I was watching Civil War rean-actors dressed up as cowboys. Not even worth the digital video it was recorded on.\n",

      "I just saw this movie last night  and after reading all the reviews I expected a good  emotional sports film. What I got was something clichéd and boring. Yes  I thought it was boring. I saw the all-star getting hurt long before the game. I figured maybe they'd wait for him to collapse until  ya know  the game before the big one but I guess the first game is good enough.  The parental relationships were also very clichéd  with the dominating drunk father (I will say McGraw impressed me  however)  and the boy who wants to stay and help his (ailing?) mother.  I especially liked the random girls (Melissa and Maria) who were in the movie for all of 5 minutes  and placed there simply to get the football boys some action off the field. I thought ok  now how does this work into the plot again? Maybe I missed the point  beyond Well they play football in a town that loves it so the girls throw themselves at their feet point.  The sports action had some good points  but most of it was so rushed! I think the first game lasted longer than the montage of the entire playoffs! And I wasn't so sure about the continuity of the winding-down clock in the final game.  I guess I could see this movie winning the ESPY for best sports film if it was the only one released. Honestly though  I found it to be a boring movie full of people sickeningly-obsessed with the pigskin. For a better football film  see Remember the Titans.\n",

      "This four-hour miniseries production is about two hours longer than necessary  primarily because the filmmakers seemed not to have a clear idea how to adapt a novel to the screen. They seemed not to know what should be kept in and what might safely be left out. The film opens with Sir Walter reading from the Peerage book that is his primary solace in his troubles. This introduces the family - all of whom we get to know intimately over the next four hours anyway - but serves little other purpose. Similarly  the scenes where the Musgroves lament poor Richard serve no purpose but to drag the story down. Some of Austen's actual dialogue is allocated to different characters and some of her narrative is recycled as dialogue that falls awkwardly from the tongues of the characters. There is some fill-in dialogue  too  and this is uniformly dreadful. The scene where Charles Hayter is boring Henrietta with his concerns about getting Dr. Shirley's curacy was only barely interesting as narrative in the book; as a scene in this production  it is stultifying The scene on the Cobb  when Louisa falls and is taken up lifeless!  is entirely without urgency  and I wondered whether Wentworth's line Is there nobody to help me? might have been directed at the writers  as well as the other actors.  This production often looks and feels like a play that has been filmed  rather than an actual film  and this is most evident in the acting  which is the opposite of subtle: booming delivery of lines  exaggerated gestures  and actors who have no idea what to do with their hands  feet  or faces when they are not speaking their lines. Charles Musgrove stands in his parlour  feet shoulder width apart  and appears to project to the balcony (if there were one) when speaking to the other people in the room with him. Louisa Musgrove's face  when not actively simpering or giggling  seems to be in confused repose. Louisa is a giddy  giggly  ditzy creature  and I did not for a moment believe that Wentworth would be interested in her.   The costumes are a mixed bunch  but mostly awful  and Anne Elliot's green tartan gown is quite possibly the most hideous alleged period costume ever devised. We are given the dates at the beginning of the show - it is the late 1790's or perhaps very early 1800s - and yet many of the costumes seem to be of Victorian design  and thus about 60 years too early! The hair is just so wrong that I won't even mention it here. Except to say that I won't mention it. :-)  This production does do some things right  however. Mrs. Smith is given her proper importance  and her history with Mr. Elliot  his dissipation and his intrigues  are fully addressed. I was also pleased to see the fleshed out reconciliation scenes with Anne and Frederick at the end  which are precious reward for the reader but were glossed over in the 1995 production.  If you love the book Persuasion  and even vaguely like the 1995 movie  don't waste a moment (or a penny) on this production; you will find it sorely wanting.\n",

The bottom line is that this movie left me angry. Not because it pretends to be real (who cares...gimmicks are allowed)  or because the actors and dialogue are so lame (is this an unusual event in horror movies?) or even because the movie is so bad (and I am being polite here). What really got me mad is that the film is not only a rip off of BWP  but also a half-hearted lazy rip off at that.  I don't believe in sacred cows and if they thought they could outdo BWP then kudos to them  but they didn't even try. The movie was made with little effort or care and that is the most unforgivable sin in horror (or any) movie!\n",

To even mention it along with Platoon or Full Metal Jacket is absurd. The battle sequences are pathetic  the dialog and acting atrocious.  This so called group of storm troopers are regulars in the Wermacht. Not SS troops. There is so much wrong with this movie it's sad. Bad editing  bad acting. It's got it all.  The movie goes on and on and on as though the audience should be made to suffer as much as the soldiers did.  I read in a review that the this film had a $20 million budget.  For real? Where was it spent? In the fake train car sequences? In the pathetic special effects? Ugh.  As a WWII history buff  and WWII movie fan  I found this movie to be a serious disappointment.

It starts out well enough. the opening scene was actually pretty tense  but from there it's all downhill. I can see that the filmmakers were trying to do something different with this movie  but by doing so  they took all the enjoyment out of watching it. Those choices combined with the C.S.I editing  use of music and montage  lack of suspense  scares  or humor really drag this film down.

      "As to be expected  there's a pretty good reason why this film is so obscure and unknown in spite of dealing with the always-popular premise of zombies and starring the 80's B-movie queen Linda Blair  namely: it sucks! The Chilling is trying enormously hard  way too hard  to be a story with depth and factual background  whereas it should have just been a light-headed and gore-packed horror flick about frozen zombies. It takes an incredibly long time before anything remotely interesting or significant happens. There's a lot of drivel about cryogenics  which I learned in my physics class is the study of products and their behavior at extremely low temperatures. So naturally  in this film a bunch of people are studying the behavior of human corpses when deep frozen. Needless to say this is extremely boring  until two dim-witted night watchmen decide  during an electric power failure  that it's a good idea to put the metal-constructed cool cells outside at the heights of a thunderstorm. The coolers are struck by lightening  obviously  and the bodies spontaneously defrost and come to live to go on a murderous zombie rampage. The Chilling is a boring and surprisingly (for a late 80's effort  at least) gore-free horror film that doesn't even use up a quarter of its potential. All the painful attempts to build up an atmosphere of suspense and eeriness fail tremendously and I can't think of any reason why the zombie-attacks had to be so bloodless. Even in spite of the low budget available  they could have done better. The set pieces  make-up effects and costumes are pitiable. The research lab  for example  looks like a proper apartment flat whilst the zombies couldn't look less menacing with their green faces and foil-wrapped outfits. How Linda Blair managed to get involved yet again in such an embarrassing low-budgeted horror flick is a complete mystery. She's attracted to lousy B-movies like bees are to honey.\n",

      "CORRIDORS OF BLOOD   Aspect ratio: 1.66:1  Sound format: Mono  (Black and white)  London  1840: Whilst attempting to formulate an anaesthetic solution  a dedicated surgeon (Boris Karloff) becomes addicted to narcotics and is blackmailed by local bodysnatchers.  Riding the coat-tails of a Gothic revival occasioned by the recent success of Hammer's THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1957)  Robert Day's CORRIDORS OF BLOOD is an odd mixture of historical drama and Grand Guignol theatrics. Producer Richard Gordon lured Karloff away from Hollywood - where his movie career had become stalled in a B-movie rut (VOODOO ISLAND  FRANKENSTEIN 1970  etc.) - for a couple of lurid shockers in which good men are thwarted by circumstances beyond their control. In GRIP OF THE STRANGLER (1958)  he played a novelist who stumbles onto a horrific secret whilst researching a series of murders from recent history  while in CORRIDORS OF BLOOD  he's a drug-addicted surgeon who falls prey to a gang of criminals masterminded by East End pub landlord Francis de Wolff. Less a horror film than a melodrama with ghoulish trimmings  the movie hedges its commercial bets by including a number of gory thrills (a leg sliced open  a face destroyed by acid  etc.)  but the narrative is motivated chiefly by Karloff's altruistic pursuit of an anaesthetic formula that will alleviate the terrible suffering of patients during surgery.  Produced under the title 'The Doctor from Seven Dials'  the finished movie went unreleased until 1962 due to indifference by distributors MGM  by which time co-star Christopher Lee had earned a prominent screen credit  despite playing a small - but significant - role as 'Resurrection Joe'  a sinister Cockney thug who murders carefully selected patrons of de Wolff's squalid pub and sells the remains to local doctors. Lee filmed this glorified cameo before THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN catapulted him to international stardom  which accounts for his limited screen time  though his intense performance is one of the film's highlights. Adrienne Corri (VAMPIRE CIRCUS) distinguishes herself as de Wolff's partner in crime  and there's a feast of familiar faces in supporting roles  including Francis Matthews (DRACULA: PRINCE OF DARKNESS)  Betta St. John (THE CITY OF THE DEAD)  Finlay Currie and Nigel Green.

      "When something can be anything you want it to be or mean  it's bound to register with someone as being rather special. But just as the shape of a cloud in the sky may appear to one of us or remind us of a battleship  and to another of his aunt's rear  and yet to another absolutely nothing other than a cloud  this does not make this cloud meaningful except for the viewers' interpretation. Anyone who might find throwing a stuffed giraffe out of a window brilliant  or worthwhile for that matter  without relating it in some context  is possibly merely trying to impress us with his or her intellectuality.  Submitting to this movie as the dreams of a madman does quite nicely  especially since there is no standard or expectation for what said dreams would be like  and even if we were mad ourselves  this would hardly give us sane reference points for comparison. A love affair with this movie entails the same risk as seriously interpreting Nostradamus. Whatever real meaning was being conveyed at the time might be buried in the private jokes  musings  or provincial minutiae of its day  and to a select few radical intellectuals at that! I did spot a bit of an agenda even with my limited capacity though.  The movie is definitely anti-Fascist and to some extent anti-Italian. I noted that although the years 1929-30 were years of great public works and urban renewal in Italy  any indication of this seemed avoided. Furthermore  (avant-guarde academic spinners take note of this for your next class) the very short cropped haired man with the mustache in the party segment near the end is a caricature of Victor Emmanuel III and his tall female companion none other than Queen Helen  formerly Princess of Montenegro. Without an understanding of potential historical relevance  even the apparent irrelevance is beyond the competence of academic or other intellectual poseurs who would bask in irrelevance to impress us.  I gladly add my own paint buckets to the defacement of this cinematic joke. But in an adaptation of the famous mot by the little boy; The movie really has no face (to deface).

      "Of all the E.R.Burroughs screen adaptations that Doug McClure starred in the 70s  this is the stagiest of all. It's so stagy  you can taste the dust of the sets and feel the heath of the lamps above. The thing looks like a very  very big budget school play  or indeed  a very very low budget action movie  which it actually is. It's been said on many occasions that this was the last of the genre entries  and I do hope it was. The genre didn't die peacefully  but in horrible agony  amidst a lot of smoke  fake blood and lousy sound effects. Peter Cushing must have felt a boy again  as a nutty professor whose shirt stays white as snow after the gentlemen has dragged himself through the slimy crap-holes of the Underworld. What a sport he was  to accept a part in this mishmash and carry it so bravely.  Shot entirely on a sound stage and accompanied by then trendy  now unbearable synthesizer soundtrack  the main anti-attraction of this film are the cardboard monsters. Yes  there are always monsters like that in a Burroughs adaptation  but they rarely manage to be so completely ridiculous  helpless or void of any credibility. On a few occasions  during the elevated action-combat scenes where Mr McClure heroically attacks the creatures  you can almost hear the empty  hollow sound as his head bangs against the side of a triplodactocryptosaurus. Fortunately  the animals explode and go up in flames the minute they trip and fell over. Indeed  there is a great deal of unmotivated exploding as the film (and the genre) draws towards the finale. And lovely Miss Munroe loses her underworldly accent.  The triple bill  currently on the market  features this film plus two others - The Land That Time Forgot and The War Lords Of Atlantis. The first two are quite strong entries  especially the first one  with a lot of money invested and occasionally even fascinating script turns. Don't expect any of these qualities from this film. Get drunk with pals and laugh shamelessly at what you see. After all  the makers didn't have any shame either.\n",

You see  the idiots in charge of syndicating the series thought it was too violent so they cut this out of the episodes. That's bad enough  but what else they did is beyond belief--they actually chopped the episodes apart and spliced them together to create shows that were NOTHING like the originals! For example  one episode might be made up of parts of episodes 3  6  18 and 27! As a result  I really don't know if the original show really was bad--it might have been brilliant.

      "This movie is about a young couple running away to start a new life in LA  who end up being stalked by a psycho at a deserted rest stop. Actually  it's really just about the girl (Nicole)  since her boyfriend literally disappears within a few minutes. The movie gets going extremely fast  and early on you wonder how it could possibly stretch its story out to feature length. It isn't long before you realize that the movie does this by simply wasting time with unnecessary scenes that go nowhere.  The story is not only paper-thin  but unstructured  stupid  and incoherent. Minutes after the disappearance of her boyfriend and car  Nicole finds a mobile home at the rest stop. She sees the flashing of a camera  and KNOWS that people are inside  but she easily gives up on trying to get their help when no one answers her door knocks. After she is informed by the killer that her boyfriend is in danger  she walks around the rest stop  doing all sorts of stupid and unnecessary things. This includes turning on a TV (and even looking amused when she thinks she's stumbled onto a porno movie  even in this dire situation)  sitting around  wandering  and drinking from a bottle of liquor for hours on end. She does all this KNOWING that her boyfriend has been abducted  that the killer is still on the loose and stalking her  and without taking any actions to ensure her immediate safety (she doesn't bother to lock the doors or remain alert). Oh yeah  she tries using a radio to call for help  but why even bother when there's a mobile home with people inside RIGHT THERE at the rest stop? It really seems like the script writer forgot about this important fact while writing this part of the story.  There's no sense of entrapment or ever-present danger in this story. The heroine freely wanders in and around the various buildings at the rest stop  and the killer only drives in occasionally to scare her  before driving off again. There's NOTHING stopping Nicole from simply taking off (even if the rest stop is a long way from anywhere else  that's better than sitting around)  but she chooses to stay anyway. At one point in the movie  the main character even ACKNOWLEDGES that she can run off  but doesn't.  The story doesn't go anywhere  and instead just jumps from pointless segment to pointless segment. Nicole finally gets inside the mobile home  and it turns out that the inhabitants are a family of sheltered  presumably inbred or psychotic religious fanatics. They seem willfully ignorant or uncaring about the killer's actions (but there's no indication that they're connected to him in any way)  and then kick Nicole out after several minutes.  In the next irrelevant segment  the main character wanders into the bathroom building. She discovers one of the killer's previous victims (a young woman named Tracy)  who is still alive and locked in a closet. For some strange reason  Tracy starts vomiting ridiculous amounts of blood. Nicole goes off to fetch a crowbar to pry open the closet door  and when she returns a minute later  both Tracy and her pool of blood have disappeared without any explanation. What was the point? Nicole finds a bulletin board showing many missing persons  and sees that Tracy had disappeared in 1971. So  was Tracy a ghost or something? The writer never bothers explaining.  Next  a cop shows up in the middle of the night to man the police office at the rest stop  which had been conveniently left unattended for the entire day so far. Nicole tells him all about what's been going on  and when the killer drives up in his truck outside the office  the cop goes outside to confront him. What does the police officer do  knowing that something is seriously wrong? He goes up and calmly talks to the killer (who Nicole had even pointed out to be the guy who was stalking her)  and buys into the killer's lie that he was simply driving through and needed directions. Seriously. The cop then talks to Nicole outside  totally unaware as the pickup truck turns around and runs him over.  The cop quickly starts telling Nicole that he's a goner who's lucky to be breathing still  yet he strangely doesn't die for quite a while. The two of them do some more pointless talking  and the all-important fact that he has a gun is annoyingly not even mentioned for too long a time. When the two of them finally try to use the gun  Nicole stupidly wastes most of her bullets blindly shooting at a door when the killer was possibly behind it. With two bullets left  the policeman tells Nicole to use one to euthanize him. She fires one into his mouth  and he lays still for a few moments  with a chunk blown out of his head. Then  he suddenly and inexplicably yells out You missed! and she has to shoot him again. Completely cheap attempt at shock.  Nicole finally confronts the killer",
      "and fails. The movie ends with a scene taking place not long from then  with a woman arriving at the now strangely much more active rest stop. In the bathroom building  she hears Nicole crying for help in the closet (locked in like Tracy was). She gets a policeman to go inside and check it  but he finds an apparently normal and clean closet. The cop leaves  thinking he's been tricked. A battered Nicole is seen coming out from behind some boxes in the closet (she would have been easily spotted if the cop had spent all of 10 seconds looking)  apparently too stupid to have said or done anything when the policeman was there. WOW.  This movie is apparently the first in a new line of quality direct-to-DVD movies  marketed as being too extreme for theaters. In reality  it's just more cliché  B-Movie garbage.\n",

      "What is it about drug addiction that so draws first-time filmmakers to offer their own take on the subject? This subject has been done to death. Drug abuse is bad. We get it. Drug addiction is painful to watch. We get that too. But the bleak subject matter doesn't give the filmmaker license to make a sloppy film. Every film need not be Hitchcockian masterpiece of cinematic excellence  or use Orson Wellesian deep focus  but it's still a narrative movie. Verite does not mean pseudo-documentary. Even consumer mini-DV cameras are capable of producing white whites and black blacks  and this filmmaker is just being lazy by shooting no contrast scenes with existing lighting: the subject is bleak enough without artificially forcing it with sloppy cinematography. And even documentary films have a sound mix. Vera Farmiga is very talented  given the right material  but the director obviously over-directed her and sucked all the life out of her performance. Addicts may live in a fog  but they still have emotions  but none of these characters seem to exist off-screen. The supporting players merely delivered their lines without creating real people. Sorry to be so harsh  Debra  but some things are true whether want to believe them or not. I'm sure your next film will be better -- but please  not another drug movie. :)\n",

I started watching it but found it that bad that I ended up watching it in 4x speed to get it over with and get rid of the annoying dialogue  but I said I would watch it and I did even if it was in 4x speed.  To cut a long story short Killjoy 2 kicks off where Killjoy left off. By this i don't mean the plot  I mean the complete and total bag of dirt known as acting and cheapness. I have nothing against low budget movies  in fact I kinda enjoy them  they are something different from Mega budget blockbusters  but this film is just terrible! The acting is diabolical and the script... well i think you could of given Stevie Wonder a pen and paper  and he would of produced something much better! This movie is just annoying  not to mention the annoying laugh the clown has which is so obviously dubbed! I didn't make it through this movie anyway  about three quarters of the way through it was time to turn it off and throw it through the window. It may of been a rip off to buy as a DVD but as a frisbee it was a mega bargain!   Please for the love of mankind itself DO NOT watch this muck  it is possibly the worst thing I have ever seen and considering some of the muck I've seen thats saying a lot!

      "Midnight Clear has a great premise. A group of over-educated  overly bright GI's are sent out by incompetent leaders on a vague mission to patrol around an isolated farm house on the eve of the Battle of the Bulge. The GI's encounter a group of battle-weary German regulars  and it becomes clear that they don't want to fight anymore.  Therein lies the problem. It's really pretty simple. If the Germans want to surrender  they do so and that's the end of the movie. If the Germans want to fight  they do so and that's also the end of the movie. So instead of doing either the GI's and Germans play games with each other  even throwing snowballs at one point. Interesting for one or two scenes  but it soon becomes very annoying. After all  these are GERMANS. The enemy. Nothing in this film makes me think they should not be either taken prisoner or shot. The film does noting to make them more human. In fact  much of what the German characters did made ME want to shoot them  including one scene where the German officer refuses to deal with a Jew or to surrender to a mere enlisted man! Why should I care about such characters? Just shoot them and let's move on to the Battle of the Bulge. It's much more interesting  anyway.  One good scene: The GI's are returning from a recon of the German position  where they had the Germans in their sights but did not fire. While walking across a clearing  they realize a group of Germans have their Mausers leveled at them. The Germans are about 100 yards away. The GIs then do something I've NEVER seen any GI's do in any Sillywood movie. They throw down their rifles and throw up their hands! Unusual as this may be in films  it is an entirely sensible reaction to having a rifle aimed at you from that distance. Though it seems far  in reality it's point-blank range for those rifles. I'll lay odds that someone working on this film was a cruffler!\n",

      "I can't believe how bad this film is. For starters  the movie deals with the legend of Big Foot and a group of people having a close encounter with the creature. The premise is interesting and having Lance Henriksen in the cast (ALIENS)gave The Untold a promising outlook. Unfortunately that's as interesting as it gets. This looks like a direct to DVD release...or so I guess. This is basically a production-less affair with probably the worst editing (with a constant fading to black in between every scene!!!)I've seen in my life and acting that will sure make you cringe. Why Lance Henriksen picked this is completely fathomless. And the movie takes cues from just about any other genre movie  from Blair Witch Project (The video scene) and Predator  to Alive. This is supposedly based on true events  but the only truth to be found herein is just how BAD this movie is. I'm usually not a harsh critic and believe me  I DID try to enjoy this trash but eventually did NOT. Do yourselves a favor and steer clear from this DVD.   I'll try to put it mildly: This movie is PURE garbage and it made me want to take my gun and shoot my neighbors... or ask BLOCKBUSTER for a refund!!!  And Lance  shame on you! 1* out of 10*\n",

      "So many bad reviewers  it made me wonder  what people are thinking while watching a simple flick made by a quite bad director??? Did you all expected a super-hit flawless movie?? No way  you already can see  Raj Kumar Kohli loves multi-starrer movies... All of his earlier works where multi-starrers  but no one was flawless. Take the first Jaani Dushman for instance  so many flaws  but still good fun. Anyways sticking to the movie  the movie Jaani Dushman is a Hindi fantasy film about a snake  who can take any form (Armaan (Munish) Kohli) which takes revenge for the suicide of its lover (Manisha Koirala) on the people who caused it. Its quite good  with a great star-cast. But i think it could have been much much better. For instance  take the script  can't say its flawless. For example Take the ages:  Do 40-48 yrs old still study in university??  There are many many more  i won't list more  but there are dozen more. A solid 5.5 is good for this one.  **.75\n",

      "For all its wonderful images  for all of its good intentions  this just comes off as yet another disgustingly one-sided  over-glorified  self-promoting propaganda.  The message is simple  All Japanese fighting on the Kokoda Track were sadistic  malicious f*** sticks who enjoyed gutting every last Aussie troop  cutting their throats before beheading them. Not only does Kokoda pick up on Gallipoli's only flaw (that the enemy are faceless  nameless  and apparently inhumane)  but manages to prove quite the opposite to Weir's masterpiece. Instead of giving us a perfect film with one flaw  we have a horrible mess with one redeeming feature.  Let's start off with this: we're  without any comfortable adapting to the characters  introduced to these apparently quite laid back  two-dimensional people who we never... EVER get to sympathize with. We're kept at such a distance that even when we could so easily relate to the characters  they find a way to keep us away. That alone is a sickening feature  as it drives us from the very plot  helps the horrible pacing to leave us with a lasting impression  and makes it so much easier to see the contrast between an overtly sentimental ending and an otherwise lackluster body of a film.  In other words  it drags us through a painful journey (not just for us  but apparently for them) and just as it should end  we're thrown into another eye-roller of a skirmish that ends faster than it began. So  for the as yet STILL uninformed: when it should end  it starts up again  only to end when we expect more. S***! It's just a confusing and agonizing pace!  Which brings me to the ultimatum: this is meant to educate us on the events of the Kokoda track. It doesn't come close. Not only does it detail a very small  insignificant part of the campaign (sprinkling a little mateship on top in an attempt to make it relevant)  but it succeeds in doing the one thing a film as important as this should be does  it makes us NOT care.  Honestly  my eyes were constantly glued to my watch the entire time. The audience around me  all proudly Australian  bickering as they came in about how great the film is going to be  groaned  moaned  and whined in disappointment as every one of the painful ninety-five minutes droned on (for a short running time  it felt like Apocalypse Now: difference being that Apocalypse Now was a good film and deserved the three hours it got) and on to the point where suicide could wholeheartedly be an alternative should it be mandatory for this film to be watched.  Though  considering how much the TV has been advertising this trash  I'd say it is mandatory  in a subliminal sense of the word.  Watch if you like pretty images. Though you'd do better watching The Constant Gardener or Gallipoli anyway  since they have superior cinematography and ACTUAL plots.  Overall: *\n",

      "You know - I've been in some towns where the girls weren't all that pretty. In fact I've been in some towns where they're downright ugly. But it's the first time I've been in a town where there are no girls at all I am sure the fans of great classic remember this phrase that belongs to Vin... one of the TRULY magnificent seven (from the first movie)...  Now I'd want to re-phrase him here. You know - I've seen some movies where the plot isn't all that good. In fact I've seen some movies where the plot is terrible  but that's first time in my life that I saw the film where there isn't any plot at all.  OK. Maybe my above statement is little bit over the top  but honestly... how one can call the plot a crap that is going on in this movie. The bad guy (oh  don't ask me to give you his name  because I don't remember and his not even somehow close to Calvera who's name and character is unforgettable...) is trying to build the church in the name of his late sons  that were killed in some battle  and this bad guy is kidnapping poor villagers to force them to build the church...  first of all how big must be church to have to force hundreds of villagers to build it... is it some Egyptian pyramid or something? but OK  let's stop here about the plot and absolutely forgettable character of a bad guy and let's say few words about The Seven itself...  Yul brynner's good old Chris  always calm  always silent  talking less but talking wise is gone (unfortunately). Oh no... he's as calm as he was... but now  he's calmness are so fake that you just don't buy it. (imagine  he meets a good old friend Chico  who he must rescue after so many years and there is just a few hi  Hello and not even handshake (as far as I remember))... honestly  it looks more like meeting of two strangers in some internet chat  rather then meeting of Chris and Chico. That makes new Chris more look like robocop or terminator rather then our beloved wise quickgun...  I won't stop here talking about other characters. There simply aren't ANY... (imagine if strong actor like Yul Brynner is so much fake forgettable  then what will be other characters look like)...  There still are some attempts to give us a background story for each one of them... for example one is women favorite guy  second is a man with dark past who's wife was raped and killed by indians and he since then is killing everyone and everything that is moving... but non of these characters are making any sense or non of them can take your heart.  I remember I was a little child and when O'reilly (Charles Bronson's character) died in the first movie I was crying. Here  I just didn't care about each one of them... even if whole of them with all the crew of the film would die  it seems I wouldn't care more...  So  please  go and SEE THIS MOVIE... I recommend it  because you won't have the other chance to see something worse then it.\n",

      "Imagine an exploitive remake of The Defiant Ones with a black chick and a white chick attached to each other. Set the story on some Caribbean island where the drug dealers rule and the revolution has arrived. And have the black woman be from Huggy Bear's stable of ladies and the white woman be a watered down Patty Hearst and you've got Black Mama  White Mama.  In those waning days of the drive-in theater this item must have been a big old hit. All the hot buttons of the Seventies are pushed in this one. Even though they both fill out their clothes better and will get a few whistles from the males in the audience no one is ever going to mistake Pam Grier and Margaret Markov for Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis. All right  Halle Berry and Jamie Lee Curtis.  Margaret and Pam are prisoners where the guards and the warden look lasciviously at the new fish arriving. Margaret is a rich girl from the state who took up 'the revolution'  whilst Pam's your basic high priced call girl who's been servicing the local drug kingpin and grew tired of it and tried to leave the island.  Margaret's fellow revolutionaries ambush the bus transporting them from the women's prison to town  but they get lost in the escape. Both have their different agendas  but like Sid and Tony they can't quite agree on whose agenda comes first. Makes for some interesting times as the police  the drug dealers  and the revolutionaries are all looking for these two illfated chain buddies.  Just so you don't get any wrong ideas the head of the revolutionaries and Markov's kanoodling partner is named Ernesto played by Filipino actor Zaldy Zshornack. The whole mess was shot in the Phillipines who were getting their own film industry started.  Nice location photography in the Phillipines is all that Black Mama  White Mam has to recommend it. But if you're a fan of really bad black exploitation flicks  this is one for you.\n",

      "This episode had potential. The basic premise of a woman living next door to an empty apartment (but a phone that constantly rings) is somewhat interesting. And when she explores the noise  there is genuine tension and fear. But stupid script writing ruins any promise the episode had.  First of all  the woman readily admits to seeing things that would send most of us running in the other direction (e.g. It's funny that the door slammed shut even though there is no wind; This door has serious damage to it that wasn't here a minute ago; The door opened by itself  without me touching it; etc.). Given these supernatural phenomena  plus the fact that a woman committed suicide in the room  wouldn't she take some precaution before entering it? Maybe she could investigate in the day time. Or maybe she could investigate the apartment with somebody else. Or maybe she could TURN ON THE LIGHTS!!! Also  while in the haunted apartment  she decides to make numerous phone calls to the operator and gets into an argument over who has the power to disconnect the phone  and then they begin discussing the details of the suicide. JUST UNPLUG THE PHONE! The phone company doesn't need to be involved. Walk up to the phone and unplug it. Case closed.  Finally  showing the phone scamper across the floor like it's alive was just comical. If the director wanted the woman to get strangled by the phone card  he could've done it in a way that didn't look cartoony. Brave Little Toaster anyone?\n",

      "There is a phrase by the experimental filmmaker Nathaniel Dorsky  who says some films are structured like a camera mounted on the head of a dog who goes down an alley  sniffing everything along the way.  That's how this movie is. The structure is Kurosawa started out as a baby  then he became a kid  then a young man  then a movie director  then he started making 'masterpieces'  then he grew old  The End. The word 'masterpiece' is used a lot in this film to describe Kurosawa's output  without explaining *what* makes his films so good/great. Just because the off-screen narrator reading a script says that a film is a masterpiece  are we supposed to kiss his rear-end and accept that a certain movie is one of the great works of art of the 20th century? And one more point. The voice of Paul Scofield is used as the voice of Kurosawa  when excerpts from the director's memoirs are being read off screen. He brings pear-shaped Shakespearean tones to the text...but why him?? If you were making a documentary about Billie Holiday  would you use Dame Judi Densch as her voice????\n",

      "The untold origin of the Lone Ranger. It shows who he was and how and why he became the Ranger.  Legendary bomb. The idea was not a bad one--reinvent and introduce the Lone Ranger for 1980s audiences. Right off the bat though there were problems. The studio ordered Clayton Moore (the original Ranger) to stop appearing anywhere as the Lone Ranger. It led to a nasty little battle that made headlines. I know of people who refused to see the film because of how Moore was treated. Also they hired the awesomely untalented Klinton Spilsbury to play the Ranger. Spilsbury was very handsome and muscular but had absolutely no charisma and just couldn't act. In fact his whole vocal performance was redubbed by another actor! Also his off screen antics (public drunkenness and beating people up) didn't help matters. Acting aside  the script is dull and slow. Also the Ranger himself doesn't show up until an HOUR in! There were some complaints at the time that the movie was too violent for a PG. However I don't think it was that bad.  There are a few (very few) things done right here--the photography was truly beautiful; Michael Horse was excellent as Tonto; Christopher Lloyd is lots of fun as the villain and when the Lone Ranger finally shows up (with the William Tell Overture booming from the soundtrack) it's really rousing. But  all in all  this is a boring and terrible attempt to bring back the Lone Ranger. It's easy to see why this bombed. A 4--mostly for the photography.\n",

Eventually it would have been Technicolor  Cinemascope or Imax. This movie must have been a misguided attempt to introduce a new element to the talking picture. During all the emotional scenes  the character stops in mid dialogue and their inner thoughts are narrated while they gaze off into the distance or appeal to the camera. This interruption is painful at it's very least. Imagine these top tier actors trying to look busy while the narration drones on. Painful. I have no idea who came up with this gimmick  but it was the only time I ever saw it used - and for good reason. In every scene the actors were forced to roll their eyes  wring their hands  or overact to such a degree  I actually wondered if this was really a comedy.   The story is a hopeless soap opera that takes place over a couple of generations. Norma Shearer  disappointed in love  searches for a reason to live. She has a friend  played by Ralph Morgan  who worships her - but she takes him for granted. She is attracted to a doctor  played by Clark Gable  but he is self absorbed and isn't interested in her. She settles for a weakling that needs her desperately. She marries him only to find that there is insanity in his family and she can never have a child with him. Along comes the doctor who selfishly pops a bun in her oven  only to find out later that he loves her after all. The child builds confidence in her husband who becomes a success  but she realizes that it's really Clark she loves after all. Confused yet? Forget the rest  just watch a couple of episodes of As the World Turns and it'll all become clear.  If your are ever forced to watch this movie  hold out for the final scene.

      "The screenplay is the worst part of this film  as it lurches from one premise to the next  missing all the important bits that would have made a number of different stories possible. (This film is confusing  because the audience doesn't know what the story is.) I had no problem with the low-production values and the acting wasn't great  but this is telly  so it was fine. I don't mind if some scenes looked like they were done in one take. But having such a non-sensical screenplay is completely unnecessary. Did any executive actually read it before forking out the cash? Avoid this at all costs.  The prologue in particular was so poorly written  it needed a voice-over to fill in all the details that had been left out. The prologue was rushed  it wasn't clear what was happening  ie. The Russian Revolution was reduced to Some riots are happening in Petersburg  with the next scene being soldiers arresting them. I know the basic history of the Revolution  so I could fill in the details  those pesky Communists. The prologue is best ignored.  This could have been a thoughtful study of a person who is confused about who she is. It sets up this premise in the asylum. It could then have her struggling to identify herself for the rest of the film. No. Gone. The film assumes she is who she says she is (even though there is still no empirical evidence.) It sets up a melodramatic romance  a love so strong  it'll believe anything she says. Okay  a soppy romance. No  because it makes no sense. The love interest seems like a crazed (and incidentally  sleazy) lunatic  bursting out in wild gestures. This also doesn't work  because the film stupidly decides to tell the truth in the monologue at the end. They never got married and she returned to America. The love story collapses. Despite there being plenty of love scenes  I was never convinced of the reason that they were in love. I find rom-com romances more convincing  despite there only being one or two scenes which establish that they've even spent any time with each other.  It could have been a thriller-type thing where the film assumes she is who she says she is  and she struggles to prove her identity. No  the court case is summed up rather than dealt with. The bizarre voice over comes back  again to fill in the details of a better film.  The funniest thing to consider is what really happened. Anna Anderson was a loony who went to America and married another loony and they did crazy things together. Throughout her life  she had bouts of lunatic behaviour. None of this in the film either. There's a really annoying character in the asylum who crops up from nowhere and announces herself as a 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Next/'Twelve Monkeys'-type informant.

During those few minutes I do not laugh once  experience no pleasure in what I am viewing  and find myself more depressed that angry. Interestingly  I am told the psychological states are incompatible  that is  one cannot be angry and depressed at the same time. This movie tests that theory.  I think part of the problem is that I spent nearly ten years in Chicago so as I am watching the scenes I am thinking of my own experiences in that rotten town and thus I am clearly bringing a lot of my baggage to the piece. It is entirely possible  I am willing to concede  that if you are not a Chicago denizen you will find the piece amusing. If so  I envy you.  And yet. John Hughes set his films in Chicago and those movies worked for me. I think the difference is that Hughes was a first rate writer. I think it obvious he knew how to comically balance his situations  as well as make his characters both sympathetic and believable. In a comedy (as distinguished from a farce) this balance vital. And it is not easy to achieve. If it was everyone would be making great movies and we would not have to fret as we do in the real world wondering when genius will ever appear. In Adventures in Babysitting  it doesn't. I hated those characters.   There is a difference  profound and real  between sympathetic and simply pathetic.  For me every scene in this movie is a clunker. There is no humor  no humanity  no people one can recognize. Just actors reading their lines as if it all they can do to restrain themselves from screaming them out  certain that finally hilarity will ensue  this time for sure! It's like watching the antics of very bad comedians. It's embarrassing and after a while  usually at the point when I get up and leave  I start to feel pity for all concerned  which is a kind of emotional connection  I suppose. Elizabeth Shue is terrible. She doesn't act  certainly not act comically  and it's entirely possible she can't. But lord how she tries. She looks older than 17  and acts way younger like a seven-year old straining in a school play certain that this is how one gets an award. And she is not alone. It is as if everyone cannot relax and let the tale flow. As if everyone simply has no idea what they are doing.   Now  this was an early effort for Chris Columbus and he clearly would improve and having better writers (e.g. John Hughes himself) certainly helped  so perhaps some forgiveness is in order. But the film just reeks of desperation. Yet like I said it may work for some. If any of the above appeals to you  and it clearly did some of the reviewers  then go get the DVD and knock yourself out. Otherwise  avoid this mess like you would a dark Chicago alley where as you hurry by you can only see shadows and hear muttered threats.\n",

      "Only three words are really required for this review: Piece of crap.  If you enjoyed watching the cartoon as a child  you will find this movie to be a complete waste of your time and money. The best thing about your two hours in the auditorium will be your feet sticking to the floor.  Yes  they do use all of the names and catch phrases. The even name the dog Shoeshine (in reference to the dog being Shoeshine Boy in the cartoon). They name the love interest Polly  but she isn't Miss Sweet Polly Purebred.  My wife and son drug me to see this. They should have drugged me to see it.  The original Underdog was voiced by Wally Cox  the ultimate nerd. This one is voiced by someone with a smart alleck teenager that knows more than all the adults attitude.  As a stand alone movie  it is awful. As an homage to Underdog  it is even worse. It is not an homage. It is not a retelling of the story. It is not an updating of the story. It is purely an attempt to cash in on a known title and create merchandising. The next time I go to the store  I fear that I will see Underdog toys  pajamas  towels  sheets  clothing  etc. McDonalds and Burger King probably fought over the kid's meal rights for this.  The worst part of this movie  however  is the soundtrack. THEY DO THE UNDERDOG THEME SONG TO RAP (read that with a silent C at the beginning)! Great  now that we are going to destroy something  let's go all the way.  I knew that it would probably be bad before I went. My fears were confirmed when I arrived at my local 12 plex and found that they opened it for the first day and first showing in their smallest auditorium (and one of only four without stadium seating). Even the theatre people knew it was going to be garbage! Save your money on the tickets and invest it better by going out and buying the original series on DVD. It will be more entertaining and have better production values.\n",

      "i didn't hate this one. i just couldn't adapt to the story. it didn't really grab me. Michael Mann is a very good director but i have to disagree with his methods in this. i'm also a fan of Daniel Day Lewis. some projects he's been in are pretty rubbish but his acting is brilliant. my favourite Daniel Day Lewis films are There Will Be Blood and Gangs Of New York.  there is one thing i loved about this and that was the musical score  it gave the film a lot of atmosphere. thats about all i liked in it though. this film has a high vote as well which is a bit random. i can see that a fair few people will like this but not enough to make the overall rating 7.8.  i would give this film a miss if i was you but there is a lot of high votes for this so i guess you should watch it and make your own views on what you think. i didn't really like it............. 4/10.............j.d Seaton\n",

      "Director Lesley Selander's thoroughly routine outdoor yarn The Yellow Tomahawk (1954) pits the Cheyenne against the U.S. Cavalry with leathery tough Rory Calhoun in the middle as the seasoned  buckskin-clad Indian scout who has to lead the survivors to safety. This United Artists western was lensed in color but the TV print that Turner Classic Movies aired was inexplicably in black & white.  The action opens with Adam Reed (Rory Calhoun of Black Spurs) eluding several Indians and riding up to palaver with his old friend and Cheyenne chief  Fire Knife (Lee Van Cleef of The Good  The Bad  and the Ugly)  who has killing on his mind. Fire Knife warns Adam that his Cheyenne braves are poised to wipe out a nearby cavalry fort under construction because it violates a treaty that the Indians made with the government. On his way to inform stuck-up camp commandant  Major Ives (Warner Anderson of Objective  Burma!) about the impending Indian attack  Adam discovers a beautiful wood nymph seductively treading water in a lake. Katherine 'Kate' Bolden (Peggy Castle of I  Jury) is another of those silly women in westerns that bathe nude in the middle of Indian country without a care in the world. Castle appears to be genuinely nude in her bathing scenes  too  perhaps the most memorable scene of all in this otherwise predictable western. Naturally  Major Ives dismisses Adam's warning from Fire Knife until the commander realizes that somebody has raided his ammunition dump far outside the fort. This is one of the many questions that the Richard Alan Simmons' screenplay leaves unanswered in this trim  82-minute oater. Why would the cavalry bury their ammunition at a secret spot in the desert rather than keep it on the premises in the fort? No sooner have they made this discovery than the Indians attack  knock out of hero  and leave him as the only survivor. Before this attack  a pair of white prospectors rides into the fort. Sawyer (Peter Graves of Stalag 17) brings in his partner with an arrow in his chest. While Adam is getting hot water to help in removing the arrow  the greedy Sawyer grinds the shaft in deeper and kills his helpless partner. Later  we learn that Sawyer and his partner had struck gold. The question of the dispersal of the gold is also left unanswered after our heroes survive the ordeal. Adam and Fire Knife have one final pow-wow and Fire Knife demands that Adam hand over Major Ives or everybody will die. Naturally  Adam refuses and the Indians begin to whittle down the whites. James Best in a supporting role as a cavalryman gets an arrow in the back for his efforts. Noah Beery  Jr.  plays a aimable Mexican scout pursued by a sexy Indian damsel appropriately named Honey Bear (Oscar-winning actress Rita Moreno of West Side Story) and Robert Bray of Lassie fame is on hand briefly as the ill-fated cavalry officer that Kate had planned to marry.   The biggest surprise in this unremarkable western shot on location in Kanab  Utah  is that the evil cavalry officer Ives  who slaughtered Indian men  women  and children at the infamous Sand Creek Massacre  has been keeping a secret that he is a Native American  too! Ironically  the taut bow that Fire Knife gives out of friendship to Adam at the outset of the hostilities is what our heroic scout uses to kill the stalwart Cheyenne warrior after he has run out of bullets. The Yellow Tomahawk concludes on an ambiguous note. The survivors reach another outpost  Fort Ellis  where Adam and Ives furnish their respective reports about the issue to an army general  but we never learn the outcome of this meeting. Is this artistic ambiguity or yet another unanswered question. Producer Howard W. Koch is no relation to Casablanca scenarist Howard Koch. Ultimately  The Yellow Tomahawk is one of many pro-Indian westerns that appeared in the aftermath of Broken Arrow (1950) where the Native American is viewed as a noble savage unjustly treated by some but not all whites. Selander  who made dozens of westerns during the 1950s and the 1960s  makes this minor western tolerable despite its thin characters and familiar predicament. Calhoun stands out of an above-average cast as the always serviceable leading man  and good looking Castle is worth watching for her feminine charms. Peter Graves plays a skunk as was usual in most of his early roles. Actually  Lesley Selander did a more satisfactory dramatic version of this movie the year before called War Paint (1953) with Robert Stack. Incidentally  Noah Beery Jr. and Rita Moreno both went on to become regulars on The Rockford Files.\n",

      "This film is bundled along with Gli fumavano le Colt... lo chiamavano Camposanto and both films leave a lot to be desired in the way of their DVD prints. First  both films are very dark--occasionally making it hard to see exactly what's happening. Second  neither film has subtitles and you are forced to watch a dubbed film--though Il Prezzo del Potere does seem to have a better dub. Personally  I always prefer subtitles but for the non-purists out there this isn't a problem. These DVD problems  however  are not the fault of the original film makers--just the indifferent package being marketed four decades later.  As for the film  it's about the assassination of President Garfield. This is a MAJOR problem  as Van Johnson looks about as much like Garfield as Judy Garland. In no way whatsoever does he look like Garfield. He's missing the beard  has the wrong hair color and style and is just not even close in any way (trust me on this  I am an American History teacher and we are paid to know these sort of things!). The real life Garfield was a Civil War general and looked like the guys on the Smith Brothers cough drop boxes. Plus  using some other actor to provide the voice for Johnson in the dubbing is just surreal. Never before or since has Van Johnson sounded quite so macho!! He was a fine actor...but certainly not a convincing general or macho president.  In addition to the stupid casting  President Garfield's death was in no way like this film. It's obvious that the film makers are actually cashing in on the crazy speculation about conspiracies concerning the death of JFK  not Garfield. Garfield was shot in Washington  DC (not Dallas) by a lone gunman with severe mental problems--not a group of men with rifles. However  according to most experts  what actually killed Garfield (over two months later) were incompetent doctors--who probed and probed and probed to retrieve a bullet (to no avail) and never bothered cleaning their hands or implements in the process. In other words  like George Washington (who was basically killed by repeated bloodletting when suffering with pneumonia) he died due to malpractice. In the movie they got nothing right whatsoever...other than indeed President Garfield was shot.  Because the film bears almost no similarity to real history  it's like a history lesson as taught from someone from another planet or someone with a severe brain injury. Why not also include ninjas  fighting robots and the Greek gods while you're at it?!?! Aside from some decent acting and production values  because the script is utter cow crap  I don't recommend anyone watch it. It's just a complete and utter mess.\n",

      "I must preface this comment with a sort of admission: I suppose I just have a soft spot for the original 60s-70s TV series. I think the filmmakers here blew it from the get-go as far as casting: in a supposed remake  audiences would look for reflections of the hip  athletic Linc (Clarence Williams III)  or the cool  with-it Michael Cole  and so forth. Instead  we get Giovanni Ribisi as a poor-little-white rich boy who comes off as just pathetic  like he is in all his roles (in the office I used to work in  I amused myself once by creating a fake movie poster  casting various actors as members of the office staff; guess who I cast as the dorky son of the company President?). Danes does OK as the new Julie  but none of the characters have much to do  as the story just sort of sits there  mired in conventionality. So it's quite forgettable  besides. What was I talking about?\n",

I dressed up as a Zombie for a party and my make up looked better than the ones in this film. Especially the big guy at the beginning  it just looked like a kid had drawn on his face with crayons.  The acting is so bad I need not comment on why. The effect are also extremely amateurish  with obvious blood tubes firing a straight jet of blood out the back of zombies heads when they get shot.   It also seems many people commenting on this movie are trying to boost the rating. Nobody without their finger in the pie would rate this film above a 5/10. Frankly it is disgraceful that people who worked on this film are boosting their own ratings.  I suggest everyone avoid this movie  it isn't worth wasting the 90 minutes of your life.

      "I'm sure that any legitimate submariner would happily ship out on the USOS Seaview (yes  SOS...) Why  you could play full-court basketball in the torpedo room  it's so large. And how 'bout the bay windows in the bow  the better to see giant squids or minefields that appear out of nowhere? Did I mention the colorful mess-cook with the parrot on his shoulder? And the Admiral's stateroom with what appears to be a loft? Big bleeping sub...  OK  OK...it's never gonna win any prizes for authenticity. And if the sub is laughable  the plot is even worse. Somehow the Van Allen belts of radiation  hundreds of miles in space  have caught fire are going to make global warming look like a weenie roast. Pompous Admiral Nelson (Walter Pidgeon)  along with his sidekick Lucius (Peter Lorre  looking suitably uncomfortable) hatch a scheme to put out the fire by firing a missile into its midst.  There's plenty of intrigue (sic) along the way  with a born-again survivor (and his little dog  too!) two dames who can never leave well enough alone  a passel of red shirts who are expendable  and plot holes big enough for Godzilla to walk through. Thrill to the Seaview being chased at what looks like 60 miles per hour by another sub -- no need for advanced sonar when you can follow from 100 feet astern.  The movie careens from one cliff-hanger to another; the payoff is so anticlimactic as to be pointless  certainly not worth the 1 hour and 50 minute wait.  The technical adviser for this shipwreck must have been a 14-year old boy with a stack of Popular Mechanics magazines. Worth watching  if only to riff upon.\n",

      "First of all let us discuss about the story. It is a copy of the movie Hitch with an added Indian Flavor to it. One guy  who is a Love guru  and another man who is seemingly a sucker when it comes to ladies  and how this seemingly sucker becomes a charmer with the help of the love guru forms the story. Salman Khan is the love guru  and Govinda is the lame guy.  Now coming to artists' performance  Salman Khan overacts throughout the movie  he tries to be funny  but fails big time. You can see Salman shouting throughout the movie  no real acting is seen in his performance. Govinda pairs opposite Katrina Kaif(Oh  my god  she is one heck of a girl. A real Beauty)is in real life a 50 year old dude  and Katrina is a girl in her early twenties. In the movie Govinda looks like Grandpa of Katrina Kaif. What a pity! Coming to Execution of the movie. This movie feels like a B-Movie  and a poor imitation of the movie Hitch. Where Hitch looks like a movie with a purpose and depth  this movie is shallow and purposeless  nowhere there is justification or clarity.  Just forget this movie  for it is nothing but boring  typical Bollywood fare. Actually I give 3/10 because this is the lowest I go.\n",

      "Most films are crappy with high production values  this one is crappy without high production values. Which sets it aside from the large pool of horrible movies. As bad as this film was I need to give due respect to Kathryn Aselton who  I believe if given the proper script  could probably turn in a pretty good performance. She plays Emily the girlfriend to perennial doofus Josh  who often refers to her as Dude or Man in a non-ironical tone.  But heres the thing  Emily is a semi-believable character which means Rhett will soon need to be added to the cast  to counteract this almost believable character with a guy even more preposterous than Josh. When we first meet Rhett we learn that he is deep because he is videotaping a lizard which is PROOF that he sees the world uniquely! Rhett then shows the tape to Emily and in one of Emily's few unbelievable moments she acts impressed by this amateur tape of a lizard  WOW i believe is how she responds once again with no irony of sarcasm even mildly implied.  From the opening scene you are given warning that the camera work will be crappy  we open on a shaky close up of Josh as he attempts to win over the viewers by acting GOOFY! oh how care free this main protagonist is that he will act GOOFY! haha. This film could almost be a case study in just how BAD films can be (and for that matter just how FAR bad films can get in the festival circuit  I mean by comparison of most circuit crap this film probably did appear pretty awesome).  I believe SXSW gave this film some minor award (oh south by southwest  why do you encourage them  its only cruel). But here is where I hand this film a compliment  it is the best of the mumblecore movement. Mind you all other mumblecore movies sucked beyond belief and generally included grotesque nudity and incomprehensibly bad acting  but still  its good to be the best of something.  I haven't seen baghead yet  but it looks like maybe they have made a few strides forward  the preview at least made it appear tolerable  where as even the Puffy Chair preview couldn't really hide the fact that it was going to suck. I've gotten off topic here  anyways Rhett is most likely not portrayed by a professional actor at all  much like Josh most likely isn't an actual actor but rather the director (or brother of director  there's some mixed messages there). I think Rhett was somebodies buddy and they said hey why don't you play this guy named Rhett in the movie  the fact that Rhett is the name of the actor and character probably means the actor and character are the same  unless I am mistaken  which I am not.  If Rhett shaved the raccoon off of his face you would probably say he was attractive. So anyways Rhett  Emily  and Josh team up to bring the Puffy Chair to Rhett and Josh's dad. Some stuff happens along the way  more bad acting  bad supporting actors  crappy camera work  an attempt at significance. This film wouldn't have been bad if it hadnt been so shamelessly pursuing profound self importance.  The whole thing is amateurish  if you can view this movie without paying for it  like if its on TV or for rent at the library  then consider looking at it  just to see if you like this super cheap style of film-making. I like what the duplass' are doing the whole make a movie with nothing concept  but I wish they would make a movie that someone would want to see.\n",

      "The breadth & height of the scale of this movie overwhelm me. About a week ago I posted a commentary on the 1926 silent epic MACISTE IN HELL referring to it as staggering. Then I encountered the Pollonia Bros. BLOOD RED PLANET. Wow ...  It's all about the scale of the thinking behind it. The Pollonia Bros. and colleague John McBride were thinking so big that the musings of Arthur C. Clark & Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODESSEY is lucky it was released thirty-two years before this sweetheart. As a matter of fact  Kubrick had it easy with modelers  a budget  actual actors and major studio backing for his little Star Trek ripoff  and all that Arthur C. Clarke had to do was write the damn thing. What's so hard about muscling around a typewriter? The Pollonia brothers on the other hand had to think radical  outside of the box  and quickly. They recruited a half dozen of their friends & colleagues -- including a hot lookin' chick -- bought a bunch of colored lightbulbs  raided old office supply dumps for every keyboard  monitor and hands-free phone headset they could find  got everybody identical black turtlenecks  made off with every cupcake tin in the county  learned enough 3d modeling & texture skinning to animate a couple of space ship fly-bys  spent a couple hours drumming up a script  executed what is easily the most frightening space monster puppet since that horrible little monster Jabba the Hut carried around with him was fried by R2D2  spent literally days working with a VHS camera and an Amiga to shoot & edit their film  and came up winners. This is the best D.I.Y. direct to home video fan movie space epic I've ever seen  and in proportion to the amount of talent & resources at the disposal of the filmmakers dwarfs even LOGANS RUN or BATTLESTAR: GALACTICA (the original series) as being a chilling look at our future  right down to a newscaster wearing a mis-matched  ill-fitting 2nd hand suit. As a species  we are doomed.  Seriously for a minute  though  it is a vast improvement upon such later epics as THE DINOSAUR CHRONICALS or PREYALIEN: ALIEN PREDATORS  which is funny since it was made before either of those masterpieces. Somewhere along the lines the Pollonia's started taking it easy on themselves: This film is executed with a certain conviction that gets you to believe that you really can breathe in a vacuum wearing a dust mask and two biker squirt bottles. And the scene where the alien beast consumes a miniaturized crew member made me immediately think of where I'd seen that before: GODZILLA VS. THE SEA MONSTER  where the giant rampaging monster crab skewers two canoers and eats them on camera. That made me cry when I was a kid.  This made me cry as an adult because here I am wasting my time trying to be some sort of critic or writer or writer/critic and these guys get to have all the fun  actually making a real feature length sci-fi epic with lots of cool colored lights  a hot chick and a talking slide projector named KAL. One of the flight crew even gets to wear his black space baseball cap backwards & glower with his goatee like that clown from Metallica. Is this supposed to be a joke? No. It is an epic statement about humanity  from humanity and for humanity that deserves to be seen by anybody who has the capability to not take any of it too seriously. Look for it on a 2 disc box set called GALAXY OF TERROR in your favorite discount retailer's cutout DVD bins  which is probably where it belongs  but how many of us can say Yeah  they have a couple box sets of our movies for sale at Best Buy.   4/10: Anyone lacking in a sense of humor might want to try SILENT RUNNING or maybe TRON. But someday an alien civilization on the other side of the galaxy will intercept a transmission of this movie and decide that we actually are not to be messed with. Good work  guys!!\n",

It didn't make me scared  horrified  or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying. The jerky camera movements were also annoying. The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror. There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth  but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot. And then there's the ending. I'm still not really sure what to make of it. I guess it was supposed to be clever twist  then shed some light on the situation  but it was just stupid.

      "First off  I've read the comments by the director further down and I'd like to thank him for offering his opinion. I've always wondered what the makers of the films lambasted on MST3K felt about their works being shredded (not to mention how Best Brains acquired the rights). Rissi's comments make me curious  however  as to how much Sci-Fi could have cut the film to make it seem different (now I'm thinking I might rent it from NetFlix). Of course  I've never seen the uncut  non-MST3K version of this film but even having seen it on MST3K  I never thought of it as a bad film or something unwatchable (though I did think it was a pretty funny MST3K episode); certainly not  as Pearl describes it  skin-peelinging awful; not after seeing the likes of Future War and Hobgoblins.   As far as cutting the film  it's been done before on MST3K  at least once. Case in point: the Joe Don Baker flick  Mitchell  in which the subplot involving John Saxon's character is cut in the MST3K version  yet Joel and the Bots comment on Saxon's absence after his appearance in the beginning of the movie. If I may submit a criticism of MST3K  if you need to cut the film for time considerations  fine  but be fair to the film being cut (even if it is a film as lousy as Mitchell). Of course  such criticism is rather pointless what with the show being over  but I think that aspect of the show was kind of unfair. But anyway  if it's the case with Soultaker  it gets my sympathies.   Still  I maintain that it's an enjoyable MST3K episode though the movie itself  even the version that's been hacked in MST3K  is no where near terrible.   As a final note  in a weird coincidence or perhaps a case of Synchronicity  I happened to watch The Hudsucker Proxy the day Soultaker aired and wouldn't you know it  the guy who played Vivian Schelling's father had a bit part in that movie; one of his three other credited roles  actually.

Aside from Gallo's genius  the film however is a dull a film I have ever seen in my life and at times is so poorly done it borders on laughable. I am also a Val Kilmer fan so he was part of the reason I made such a grand effort to view the film. The problem is Val is really only in one scene. Having his name in the cast as the lead is an insult to my intelligence and to the rest of the cast. I have only seen Stranded of the directors other films. Both films are far far below average but both contain very interesting Vincent Gallo performances. If you are as much as a Gallo fan as I then see this film regardless of how bad it is. If you do not like Gallo then there is ZERO left to love.\n",

      "Interferencia starts as unemployed Martin Sanders (Andres Bagg) hears something strange on his phone  he hears a mysterious man talking to a prostitute named Diana & arranging to meet her. Soon after Martin reads a local paper & sees the front page story about a prostitute being murdered & thinks back to what he heard. Martin confides in his friends Laura (Virginia Lustig) & Aaron (Oliver Kolker) but they don't believe him. Then shortly after the same thing happens again  the phone call  the man  the prostitute & her death reported in the papers. Martin decides he has to find the killer & put a stop to his killing spree but who is it?  This Argentinian production that was apparently shot in just eight days (why so long?) on a budget of about $3 000 (why so much?) was written & directed by Sergio Esquenazi & I cannot believe some of the glowing comments Interferencia has on the IMDb. Out of 195 user ratings as I write this 113 of them rate this pile of crap 10 out of 10  I am sorry but there is no way anyone should be giving a film this bad a quite literally perfect score of 10 out of 10. If a score for a film on IMDb is fixed then this is it  I honestly don't believe that if you showed Interferencia to 195 average people that well over 100 of them would rate it as being absolutely perfect  no way on Earth. The user comments are also amazingly positive  all by IMDb users who have only wrote comments for one film  this. The one user (besides me) who has actually written more than one comment gave it a rock bottom 1 out of 10 which sounds just about right. Everyone is entitled to an opinion but I would stake my life on the fact most of those positive comments are from fake accounts set up purely to big this piece of crap up. Where do I start? How on Earth can I adequately describe how bad Interferencia is? The plot is a mess that basically lives or dies by it's terrible twists  while most twists turn a plot on it's head & alters the perspective of everything that has gone before in a clever & relevant way & are genuine surprises here in Interferencia the twists destroy the first half of the film & makes it utterly pointless in a 'it didn't actually happen' sort of way & the twist is so poorly handled that it leaves you asking more questions than it answers. What made Martin go mad? Why did he imagine the phone calls? Why did he imagine a killer? Why did he imagine the newspaper headlines? No explanation is given for Martin's behaviour during the first hour or so of the film  there's just this absurd revelation that it was all in his mind & that's it  that's all the exposition there is. Then there's a plot twist about Martin's missing wife & her lover before Martin for reasons unexplained starts to kill his friends for no apparent reason. I am sorry but Interferencia is so bad  it's so boring  it's so badly written & thought out that I honestly can't think of a positive thing to say about it. Sorry guy's but that's how I feel  quite simply Interferencia is one of the worst films I have ever seen & is a complete mess both conceptually & technically.  According to the IMDb Interferencia was hot in just eight days  to be honest it doesn't feel like that at all. Nope  it feels more like it was shot in five days! The whole film is an eyesore  Interferencia has probably the worst nighttime shooting I have ever seen. It's like no attempt was made to light the scenes  it's like the makers just went into a dark room or basement or whatever & just shoot the scene regardless of whether you could see anything. The scenes set outside in the daytime have this horrible unnatural blue green tint to them for no apparent reason which just looks daft & becomes increasingly irritating. This strange tint is not repeated on indoor scenes so they are also quite jarring & noticeable. There's no real horror or scares  in fact I would say Interferencia is more of a thriller than a horror. As far as gore goes there are two decapitated heads in a fridge  a knife is stuck in someones mouth & nothing else.  According to the IMDb this had a budget of about $3 000 which makes Interferencia one of the lowest budgeted films ever commercially released surely? Some people think just because a film is low budget all reasonable viewing standards should go out of the window & we should accept any old crap  wrong! To watch this on DVD you will still have to pay good money & I personally think we have the right to expect some sort of good product. If this can get released & praised like it's Oscar worthy then we can all release our holiday camcorder footage (including embarrassing karaoke footage & scenes of total blackness as we forgot to take off the lens cap) & win top prizes at the next Cannes film festival! The acting is awful although the female lead Virginia Lustig is actually rather sexy & helps ease the pain of the final twenty odd minutes as she features a fair bit.  Interferencia is an absolutely terrible film  seriously I beg you don't be fooled by all the fake positive comments  there is no way anyone not involved in this or have some sort of agenda is going to give it a 9 or 10 out of 10. An amateurish mess that is truly horrible to sit through. Sorry but that's the way I see it  sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind... you have been warned!\n",

      "When a group of dumb kids (including an unlikable. racist bitch) stay at an old house  it awakens four murderous Toltec spirits. Can Lash La Rue save the day? Will you be able to watch until the end due to the horrible comedy on display.  The Dark Power is the kind of really bad horror/comedy hybrid Troma used to release regularly. Thing is  they didn't. release this. That doesn't excuse the whole thing  as it has a dreadful synthesizer score (including bad attempts at Native American music and even worse comedy music)  bad make up effects (basically Halloween masks)  and atrocious acting (Ok  the fat guy was alright  though everyone else is terrible  and La Rue  a Western movie vet  seems embarrassed to be there-not that I blame him really.)  The worst thing though  is the comedy aspects. Sure  dumb teens is one thing  but when the movie keeps talking about the Toltec spirits as if they are the ultimate evil  only for them to turn out to be horribly annoying  bumbling fools  all hope is dashed. Combining horror and comedy takes at least some skill. There is no skill on display here  as it all is just stupid  and not so dumb it's fun either. I mean smoking pot and listening to bad Punk Rock aren't I dumb dumb.  Not even a decent ripped off face and a chick in little clothing can save this disaster.

      "My summary refers to the fact that this film has 1479 votes--just 21 short of making it eligible to be on IMDb's infamous Bottom 100 list--the 100 lowest rated films on the website. With a paltry score of only 1.8  this would place the film at approximately between #38 and 46 on the list--talk about a very dubious achievement!! My score of 3 isn't that bad--but it does bring the film that much closer to the dreaded list.  As for the film  it stars the once-cute Aaron Carter--yet another prepackaged and forgettable pop star of the 1990s. When he first broke onto the scene  he was a cute kid with some songs that appealed to pre-teens and tweeners on Radio Disney. His songs  look and image were all scrupulously groomed and created by marketing folks and did the trick--leading to some huge album sales. Unfortunately  by 2005  sales were in decline and Carter had hit his awkward stage of life--something ALL kids his age have to deal with eventually. To put it bluntly  he isn't cute any more in this film and is at a very tough stage of life. I assume now he's a gorgeous young man...but in Popstar he's no longer the heart-throb he once was. Here  he is just very normal...a death sentence for a kid in his position as a pop sensation.  Interestingly  the film has some appearances by some other ex-teen heart-throbs from the last few decades--including a roles for David Cassidy and Leif Garrett--two guys who also know what it's like to disappear from the limelight. Cassidy managed to pick up the pieces and make a niche for himself  while Garrett is a great example of a pop star whose life after stardom has been a bit of a joke. Hopefully Carter will take after Cassidy in the future and so far  thankfully  he's managed to avoid the negative publicity and court appearances of many ex-pop idols. I was far from thrilled with the film but seriously wish him best in this department. It's not his fault he was plastered across the radio and television throughout the early to mid-1990s.  In this film  Carter doesn't exactly need to stretch himself--he plays a pop star. However  despite making millions and being adored by girls  he doesn't have it all. He's quite dense--mostly because he has little interest in learning. The problem is so bad that his mother decides to no longer home school him--forcing him to go to public school. The problem  though  is that he is rather phobic about taking tests...and making the grade in school is difficult. So  he gets the idea of finding a smart girl to date--one who would naturally be obliged to help him out in school. He picks the cute but bookish Jane (Alana Austin) and pretends to really like her in a sad attempt to make this scheme work.  This plot  by the way  isn't bad and could work even though it seems a lot like an episode of a show like The Brady Bunch or a Nickelodeon sit-com. Sure  it's predictable and you KNOW that the formula will mean that she will eventually learn his plot and be hurt AND he will eventually realize that he actually does care for her AND by the end of the film  all will be forgiven and they'll be a real couple. But  given good acting and competent direction  this could be worth seeing for his teen fans  as predictable isn't always bad. And  as it turned out  this ISN'T exactly where the plot went...but it was awfully close.  There are a few good things I liked about the film. Seeing Tom Bosley and Stella Stevens playing Jane's grandparents was very nice--their role was quite sweet and it was good seeing them again. Also  1970s made for TV movie star Andrew Stevens appeared in the film--it was nice to see him again--though part of me hated him  as he looks so great after all these years and I look ever bit of my 45 years! He did a fine job and it was nice seeing him in the same film as his mother (Stella).  As for Carter  with his many prior experiences on TV  he was  not surprisingly  pretty good. While his relationship with Jane didn't seem very believable  he and Ms. Austin gave it their best. The film wasn't great  but they did try and I think most of the problems with the film were in the writing--with a better and less formulaic plot  it could have worked much better. Plus the whole testophobia angle seemed pretty contrived...and rather insignificant. Who cares if a mega-millionaire star gets anxious taking tests in school?! Overall  not a rotten film as the current rating would imply  though there isn't much here to attract a wide audience. People who grew up loving Carter probably will enjoy the film. Older folks will probably care less as well as really young people who probably haven't heard of him. For them  there is no nostalgia value in the film.  My favorite part of the film...Leif Garrett giving Aaron advice. I felt like screaming don't listen!! but didn't!\n",

      "My mistake for thinking this was a serious war-is-hell movie prior to seeing it. That all ended seconds into the film when the MTV logo appeared. It might as well been called National Lampoon's Sexy-N-Loose. And it did play to the MTV crowd; the movie that followed those comical first few seconds played like the music videos they used to play 40+ years ago. At least Disney was smart enough to ship its Rated R stuff over to Touchtone and allowed us to take it seriously. Okay  I'm being harsh; it wasn't that bad of a film. However  it definitely has its share of overacting and the film is extremely biased/one-sided. Admittedly  I'm not a war movie buff. I can't watch 'Platoon ' 'Full Metal Jacket' or 'Saving Private Ryan' more than once. Sure they were good movies  but they're not my forte and they all seem to blend in after awhile to where I wouldn't be able to distinguish one from the next. Following a tour in Iraq  Phillippe plans life after the war but is drawn back in due to a clause in his contract. Or  at least  that's the military's plan until he goes AWOL and the characters speed cross-country on a few bucks amazingly never caught. No  I haven't been in any war  nor to Iraq  nor do I agree with it. I also don't have all the knowledge when it comes to recruitment or signing their contracts. I can say this: though I am sorry they're drawn back into this conflict  I can't feel too much for someone so dumb not to read the fine print. It's like someone on their deathbed leaning over to finally read the Surgeon General's warning on their box of cigarettes and say  Oh  they're what? Deadly? I'll sue them!\n",

      "Okay  I just had to sound off on this one... Like a tremendous mental-gimp  I've just sat through this film in its entirety.  You'll note that the trivia section of IMDB points out that portions of the raising of the 747 were borrowed from Airport 1977. This really doesn't scratch the surface... Virtually all exterior shots of the plane skimming the ocean  landing in  sinking  and even the at-rest shots are borrowed from Airport '77. All of the raising shots are pulled from '77  including most of the interior flooding clips  with the exception of Dennis Weaver's drowning. I couldn't help but wonder if Olivia Dehavilland might come floating by at any moment  or maybe a dead Tom Sullivan. Another eye-roller: Dennis Weaver's name in this film is Stevens  which is to compensate for the fact that Airport '77's plane is owned by the Stevens Corporation (headed by Jimmie Stewart of course).  This is a veritable calvalcade of actors who don't work much  or at least haven't worked in a while  which might have been the first clue that it was going to be a real stinker.  I've rated this film a 2 - It's quite worthy of a 1  but if this film can't offer any other redeeming quality  at least somebody helped Coolio  Max Caulfield  Nicolle Eggert  and Dennis Weaver make their car payments that month!\n",

      "Following his role in the fine caper SEVEN THIEVES (1960) – which I’ve watched several years back – Edward G. Robinson seemed to be stuck playing elderly criminal mastermind types (apart from the odd juicy role as in THE CINCINNATI KID [1965]). I’d previously watched the pretty good “Euro-Cult” effort GRAND SLAM (1967) and  apart from this  I’ve yet two more similar titles from Italy to check – one of which was directed by future goremeister Lucio Fulci! Anyway  this is the kind of international production – featuring American and Italian actors and a British director – which was prevalent during the 1960s; it’s harmless and easy-going in itself but hardly memorable and definitely overlong – especially since to procure finance for the heavy-duty equipment required for the heist (such as an army tank and an airplane!)  the gang involved have to pull a variety of minor thefts first.  The gang  of course  is an incompetent lot led by an American (Robert Wagner) and his bimbo girlfriend (Raquel Welch) – the others are a ‘pacifist’ black man  a perennially hungry Italian and a diminutive Englishman. They try to induce an ex-gangster (Vittorio De Sica) to turn over his fortune to them  except he’s destitute…but  under the auspices of “Professor” Robinson  he proposes instead a caper of 5 million dollars’ worth of platinum! Needless to say  the gang members don’t trust one another (Wagner instructs Welch to seduce De Sica so as to get the name of their fence in Morocco – where they are to retreat after the robbery)  or else bungle the job (commissioned to hold up a restaurant  the Italian can’t resist sitting at table and order a multi-course meal for himself!). Amusingly  in the face of similar failures  De Sica tries to show them how they used to do it in the old days – however  ostensibly holding up a petrol station  it transpires that the owner is a nephew of his and he merely asked to borrow some cash!   The central heist sequence is typically elaborate: while the gang  including Welch  ‘take’ the train transporting the platinum  Wagner kidnaps pilot Victor Spinetti and his airplane. When the job is done  he fully intends to double-cross De Sica – but neither his partners nor Welch herself are willing to go along with this  so he’s forced to relent. Coming from the time when crime didn’t pay  the gang contrives to lose all their stash in mid-air when the plane’s bomb-bay doors are accidentally opened…\n",

Besides lacking a single redeemable character  only slightly better than average acting  and an ugly 80's style picture quality  the script for this film is dull and lifeless. This film is not only boring--it is pathetic. (Admittedly  there is occasionally some mildly interesting chemistry between the two main characters.) Even the final plot twist--rather  the only plot twist--does not save this film.  Rent Diamond Men if you must  but do not hesitate to turn it off once you become appraised of its worthlessness. 2 out of 10.\n",

Child grief is rarely explored on film  so it is refreshing to see a film like Addison's Wall. However  due to the very nature of the film  there is no tension or drama. Apart from a few key emotional moments  everything in the film is very plain. The abrupt ending that does not solve any mysteries certainly do not help the film to be more watchable. Addison's Wall could have been much better  such as exploration of the contents of the wall  a more intensive care program to help Addison to go through his trauma.

      "I had never heard of Dead Man's Bounty when I saw it at the DVD store a few weeks ago  and I thought I had stumbled upon an unrecognized gem  since it had Val Kilmer in it in a truly unique role. Sadly  it wasn't more than ten or fifteen minutes into the movie that I realized that this is a disaster of epic proportions. The first clue you will see of how genuinely awful this movie is comes near the beginning  when you have a bunch of dirtbags in an old saloon laughing like a bunch of hyenas in a scene that goes on about five times too long. It's unbelievable how bad it is. And sadly  it doesn't get any better.  Val Kilmer is featured prominently on the movie's cover box  maybe to trick you into thinking that he has a role in the film  but unfortunately his bizarre role as a dead man is overlooked in favor of focusing on a bunch of half-wit crooks and the most inept conceptualization of a unique town sheriff that I've ever seen in a movie. He's played by Boguslaw Linda  who is unable to or uninterested in covering his Polish accent  immediately making it impossible that the movie is meant to take place in the American old west.   Does Poland have this type of frontier past? I don't know. My knowledge of Polish history is not my strong point  but I can tell you this  The Sheriff  as he is known in the movie  is the worst representation of law enforcement that I can ever remember seeing in a movie. He is introduced in a truly ridiculous scene where he is wearing some kind of blindfold and a roomful of men take turns punching him in the face. Before they start hitting him  he explains that they can each hit him once  and then  after the first round  they will each hit him again  and if he can identify who is throwing the punches  they lose. What the hell is this crap? I am completely at a loss to explain why a scene like this would ever be put into any movie.   Throughout the movie  the Sheriff continues to appear more and more beaten and bruised and drunk and battered  until ultimately he does nothing but show up occasionally  stumbling on screen and mumbling not",
      "without...the law",
      " You see  there is a lot of talk and preparation for a hanging  the details of which are as meaningless as the rest of the movie.   It takes place  by the way  in a town that consists of nothing more than two ramshackle wooden buildings facing each other across a flattened bit of dirt that is more of a path than a road. My understanding is that it is a part of Poland that is supposed to look acceptably enough like the American southwest  where none of the characters  except maybe the dead guy  could possibly have come from.  I have heard that Val Kilmer accepted the role because he was intrigued by his unique role  and also by director Uklanski's minimal use of dialogue in favor of a reliance on cleverly timed juxtaposition of images in unique visual montages.   Yeah  whatever.   Seems to me that Kilimer was unable to overcome what must have been the truly satisfying feeling that he must have gotten when he was offered the role. Personally  I would really feel that I had reached quite some level of success if someone approached me and offered me probably a few hundred thousand dollars to come and lay still for a while. I like to think that he didn't even read the script for this mess  because if he did I am at a total loss to understand why he accepted the role.  At any rate  the movie opens with a man bringing in the corpse of a man  played by Kilmer  seeking the reward. Soon he finds himself embroiled in a ludicrous love story involving the town prostitute  the alcoholic Sheriff  and lots of mayhem involving a series of stupid  stupid characters.   There is also a extensive and preposterous lack of understanding of American rituals. In one scene  a man cuts a cherry tomato in half and squishes the halves into Kilmer's eyes (for what reason  I can't imagine)  and then later  a man makes a short speech over Kilmer's corpse  in which he explains that he was one of the finest men we ever had  and then he proceeds to lop his head off with a shovel. What the HELL??   Not convinced yet? Here are some more reasons not to watch it. In one scene the Sheriff appears to be covered with ash  except for the perfectly clean areas around his eyes and what can only possibly be described as bright red lipstick. A man gets a head wound that drenches his head and body in blood. In a daze  he cauterizes it with gunpowder. Smart. Near the end  the Sheriff appears to have a broken arm. Sitting at the bar  he puts a rope around his neck and connects it to his injured arm  and uses his good arm to pull on the rope  lifting his shaking beer glass in his bad arm to his mouth  rather than using his good arm to drink. Also smart.   Why doesn't he just use his good arm? I have no idea. That  like everything else in the movie  makes no sense whatsoever  like the title. Summer Love? Are you kidding me? Avoid this mess at all costs.   In the meantime  here's something for the IMDb Goofs page    Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers) : This movie got made. HA!\n",

Having said that - I did actually sit through the entire 2 hours and can't say it wasn't entirely un-entertaining.  I think the key problem is that Frank Marshall is not a true director and this is clear in the film - he is an experienced producer  so will have seen a movie made many a time  and will understand what goes into the process. But I think this is quite different to being able to truly direct a movie - the direction was competent  but somehow flat and direction-less. Marshall has more experience as a unit or second director  and this came through  I feel  in the finished product - it appeared to be a group of sets that failed to really have any continuity in its feel or its character.

      "that got destroyed quickly by the poor quality acting  cinematography  numerous pointless scenes and a terrible villain. Well let's see Joe Estevez is bad (as usual) but he isn't the only casting problem  writer Vivian Schilling is no great actress  in fact  well she sucks. Her script isn't so bad  it's just bad directed. In fact if the direction had been better and if better actors had been cast  this could have been a really good film.   But alas  with all of these problems Soultaker fails to be even kind of passable as a horror movie  plus the pacing is just awful too.   The MST crew had some fun with this one but it definitely wasn't one of their better efforts. 5 for that  nothing for the original.\n",

      "Imagine a GILLIGAN'S ISLAND set in the African desert in modern times. Add people nowhere near as jaunty as the Skipper or Marianne--and enough angst to fill a German psychiatrist's office. Throw in a plot that manages to be interesting only episodically and literary parallelism that never delves deeply enough to truly satisfy. Season with a truly morose topic that's been exploited since the first world travelers found themselves very  very lost.  If THE KING IS ALIVE weren't a product of the reigning czars du jour of Dogme 95  would this film be garnering as much attention? Dogme 95 is to Hollywood as Danish modern is to rococo. A byproduct of digital technology  this Scandinavian movement seeks--quite dogmatically--to strip away artificiality in film-making  by using more natural elements and returning to the essence of storytelling. PEARL HARBOR  for instance  is the Dogme Antichrist.  Director/co-author Kristian Levring's saga ponders interpersonal relations and human nature when placed under the fire of a life-threatening situation. Eleven people aboard a bus riding through the Namibian sand dunes suddenly find themselves stranded in the remains of an abandoned town. An African local who does not speak their language serves as observer and narrator (whose insights are among the film's most trenchant). As the strongest heads off for a five-day walk to the nearest village  the others stay behind  surviving on dented-canned carrots and circumambulating their likely future as vulture chow. Former thespian Henry decides that this rather unappealing crew needs a diversion  and hand-writes KING LEAR from memory. He assigns roles  and the group passes many days learning lines and rehearsing  in an effort to divert their attention from the seemingly inevitable.  Gradually the cast begins to lose it  and the savageries of their natureor  William Golding might say  human naturebegin to surface. If you've ever seen LORD OF THE FLIES  you know that these things can get ugly  that being in a lifeboat situation can turn even Mother Teresa into the PMSing termagant of Calcutta.  The film was shot using an international ensemble of American  English  French and South African actors  who  the Dogme dogma dictates  develop themselves and their roles quite organically. THE KING was also filmed chronologically  adding a sense of realism to the ever-increasing desperation of its characters. After up to three hand-held cameras shot in digital  results were transferred to 35mm film.  The performance that compels most comes from Jennifer Jason Leigh  who plays a boho Pop Tart trying to bolster the spirits of the group in any and every way she can. Henry (David Bradley) is another finely played character  whose passion for his life's work ultimately saves the gang from utter despair. It's hard to feel too sorry for the otherscruel wives and their oafish husbands  hirsute old womanizers  sulky French intellectuals  wealthy men who have more important places to be than marooned in the Namibian desert. Beckett might hate this question  but why is this group riding a bus together through remote Africa in the first place? Life-threatening morbidity! Utter despair rendered in graphic detail! A relentlessly tedious pace! Enjoy.\n",

Sorry Mr Boutonnat  I do admire your work (all these beautiful films you directed such as Tristana  Sans logique etc...) but here  the plot is extremely... vain ! Except the magnificent photography  everything appears dumb and there's no envy to know what will happen at these medium actors. Moreover  the dialogs are minimalists. The famous question where are the children is repeated so often it looks like a farce. Believe me  it's a pure waste of time (concerning the plot)  and 3 hours is a long long time.

      "The script seems to have been wholesale (ahem ahem  cough cough) borrowed from a certain other movie involving using a self-propelled manned drilling machine. Scene by scene  the two movies were almost identical. Just enough of the serial numbers filed off in this one to prevent a copyright infringement lawsuit.  But other than that  I have to say I found this somewhat entertaining as I enjoy deep-underground-in-the-earth genre of movies. It's a little bit on the stupid side as far as the science goes  but if one is willing to squint one's eyes real hard and pretend one didn't notice that scientific gaffe here and there and all over  this movie is almost bearable. Far better than Supernova which was another flick that Luke Perry had a leading role in that was so dumb  dumb  dumb that nothing could save it. A note to movie makers: employ someone who knows something about the subject the movie deals with. It would be a very small part of the movie budget  but it would have a big effect overall in helping prevent your audience from guffawing at you for doing dumb science.  Production values: almost passable. I've seen far worse in my time.  A new thought for disaster movies: instead of them always having a happy ending where the world gets saved yet once again  how about some where things are a tad bit more realistic  where sometimes even the very best efforts still end up in failure. Particularly when the problem that needs to be resolved was caused in the first place by sheer stupidity. Stupidity-caused disaster movies with glowing  heartwarming endings sort of backhandedly justify stupidity by stating  No matter how awful a problem is caused by braindead stupidity  it can be fixed. Which is definitely not the case. A self-caused disaster movie with an unhappy ending would serve better as cautionary tale of Don't be so damn stupid in the first place. Should you watch this movie? If you're bored and you've seen everything else in the scifi section at your local video rental store  sure  why not. But do avoid Supernova as I can assure you that you're not THAT bored. That definitely was not one of Luke Perry's better movies. This one is better. That's not saying much  but it is better.  One dead hoof up for being a deep-underground genre movie. One dead hoof down for naughtily ripping off from the screenplay of another certain movie of the same genre.\n",

Unfortunately the film then proceeds to plod its weary way through a standard Chan formula that is only barely enlivened by the always wonderful Mantan Moreland. It's as if director Karlson blew half his budget in the first five minutes  just getting the set up the way he wanted it. Watch the beginning and think about The Phenix City Story.\n",

      "I saw this film in a Cinema-Club in Germany in 1970. Most of the attendees were from the local private school at which I was teaching. I had seen a few Godard films previously while I lived in France  and  though they hadn't been my favorites  I could at least make sense of them. Being able to speak French helped.  The fairly innocuous beginning of Le week-end soon turned into a kaleidoscope of images  very well  maybe too well photographed  that soon made no sense to me. For me  films  like books  must have some clear sort of meaning. This didn't for me. I suppose I'm not into artsy films. Images still haunt me from the film. To this day I refuse to eat rabbit meat  well-loved by the French. Those who've seen the film might realize why. Yes  the theme of materialism came through  but the cannibalism  the car wrecks  and all the other scenes of destruction and horror only sickened me. I'm not sure if I walked out before the end  but I certainly felt like it. I promised myself that I'd never watch another Godard film  and I haven't and never knowingly will.  My rating: nothing. It was the most disgusting film I've ever seen. Others may have been more inept  silly or stupid. I've forgotten those while scenes from this one will haunt me forever.\n",

      "Imagine yourself trapped inside a museum of the dark middle Ages and a resurrected vampire and his maniacal sidekick are chasing you. Where is the absolute last place you want to hide? I'd say inside the uncanny Virgin of Nuremberg torture device  because there's a good risk you'll get brutally spiked to death. And yet  the elderly lady in this film stupidly runs into her spiked coffin. The Vampire's Coffin is a rather disappointing sequel  as director Fernando Méndez doesn't re-create the Gothic atmosphere of the 1957-original but puts the emphasis on comical situations and dialogs. No more ominous castles with eerie cobwebs and dark vaults  but confused doctors and clumsy assistants that provoke laughs instead of frights. The story opens inside Count de Lavud's final resting place  where an eminent doctor and a hired assistant steal the coffin in order to examine the corpse at a private clinic. Naturally the wooden stake gets removed from his heart  and the vampire count comes to live again  immediately enslaving the petty thief to do his dirty work. The vampire has his eye on a beautiful female patient at the clinic  and it's up to Dr. Enrique Saldívar to rescue her soul and to destroy the bloodsucker. The Vampire's Coffin uses a limited amount of locations and there's very little action. The whole film would actually be pretty boring if it weren't for a handful of memorable sequences and decent acting performances. The photography is amazing  though  with the sublime use of shadows and darkness. This is most notably during the scene in which Count de Lavud stalks a young woman through the deserted streets of little town at night. It's the only truly worthwhile scene of the whole film  the rest is fairly mediocre and déjà-vu.\n",

      "This is  per se  an above average film but why in the name of Bog was it made? It's impossible to treat it as a thing unto itself because it is an almost shot-for-shot remake of an Alfred Hitchcock classic of 1960. You can't watch it without the 1960 film nudging into your consciousness.  What does the word credit mean? How can we credit Van Sandt and his associates with anything except deciding to use different actors  slightly different sets  and color?  Anne Heche is attractive but lacks Janet Leigh's stolid determination to become a respectable middle-class woman. And Heche is younger than Leigh  who brought to her fruitless attempt to marry and settle down  the desperation of a woman facing forty. And Heche doesn't project anxiety the way Leigh did. The scene with the CHP officer looking in her car window illustrates the weakness in the role. In the original  the officer asks  Is there something wrong? Leigh: Of course not. Am I acting as if something were wrong? The officer hesitates before replying: Well  frankly  yes. That exchange is omitted from the remake for the simple reason that Heche isn't nervous enough.  The worst change  without a doubt  is the substitution of Vince Vaughn for Anthony Perkins. It may not be Vaughn's fault. Who could match Perkins in the role? Perkins is twitchy  bird-like  long-necked  cloaked in an externally charming exterior that masks an inner vacuum. His every move (eating candy corn  with his adam's apple bobbing) and every utterance  the faint laugh  the arid chuckle  is spot on. He just can't be improved upon. Vaughn brings to the role the presence of a short-haired beefy guy who was just discharged as a Lance Corporal from the U. S. Army. To suggest his psychosis all he can do is superimpose a maniacal giggle on top of what appears otherwise a perfectly normal Norman in speech and manner. (Unlike the original Norman  Vaughn doesn't even stumble over the word fallacy because it resembles phallus.) He could be just hanging around the motel waiting to hear about his application for a football scholarship to UCLA.  The direction deserves a few comments. I don't see what it adds to the story when we see Norman masturbating while peeping in on Anne Heche. I don't OBJECT to it. I wonder why it's there  just as I wonder why the rest of the movie is there.  And  I suppose in order to impress us with how much color adds to the visual experience  Van Sant seems to have missed a bit of Hitchcock's more subtle stuff. Heche is given underwear of all different colors -- green  pink  orange  and -- mango? Is that a color? If so  what the hell color is it? Never mind. The point is that in the original  when the traveling camera first peeks through the window of the Phoenix hotel it captures Janet Leigh in bed wearing a pure white half slip and a white bra. Later  after she has stolen the money  we see her in her underwear again -- this time both her slip and bra are black. Tis a small thing  but Hitch's own.  At that  the idea of shooting in color might not have been bad except that the black-and-white shooting of the original was superb. The color and odd lighting effects in this version turn the ordinary  dull  and subliminally ominous motel into something that looks like it belongs in the seedier part of Las Vegas.  Most of all  the 1960 film was shocking in more ways than one. I can remember seeing it in a drive-in in San Diego and staring aghast at the screen when it became clear that the central character was actually DEAD -- half-way through the movie! Nothing like it had ever been done before.  That murder in the shower  in both movies  was a big improvement over Robert Bloch's original novel  by the way  in which the author writes something like  The murderer then entered the bathroom and cut off her head with a knife. I'm not making that up. Well  not entirely. Even here  Van Sant's movie gives us excess. There is more blood and more bare flesh. And where Hitchcock closed in first on the blood circling the bathtub drain and dissolved to Marian's blankly open eye  then pulled the camera back slowly to reveal her face  he rotated his camera from a slight tilt to the proper vertical  giving the viewer a sense of not just disbelief at the murder  but a dizzying disbelief. Van Sant doesn't tilt his camera a delicate 10 or 20 degrees as Hitchcock did. He practically twirls it on its axis.  It won't do to call this a bow to Hitchcock because it's not. It's a pecuniary plundering of Hitchcock's material (already ripped off in Psycho I  II  III  IV  and Psycho: The Beginning Years  and Come Into My Parlor: Mrs. Bates' Revenge  and Hand Me That Knife  Would You?: The TRUE story of Norman Bates.) A rehashing of and grinding away at truly original stuff  a crumenal act if not a criminal one. And that's not to mention the many homages in other films  especially the French  such as the notorious ocean of boredom scenes between Marcel Brulee and Jeanne Gateau in the much-admired La Mere de la Nuit. (Maybe I'd better add that that last sentence is a terrible attempt at a parody of academic critics. And when a chicken's guts grind corn  it's a crumenal act. I won't go on except to say these gags  shabby as they are  are more fun than the movie.)  So who was it made for? I'd have to guess. Kids who are too young to know about the original and who don't like movies in black and white? Kids who are hoping to see another ordinary slasher movie? Chimpanzees?\n",

      "**** Spitfire (1934) John Cromwell ~ Katharine Hepburn  Ralph Bellamy  Robert Young   Mountain hillbilly Katharine Hepburn (as Trigger Hicks) is a religious back-woods laundry woman. Going on 18  she begins to attract male attention  and responds by throwing rocks. The arrival of a dam-building construction crew triggers dreams of romance in Ms. Hepburn. She quickly attracts the attention of suave engineer Robert Young (as John Stafford)  who flirtingly hides his marital status. Supervising engineer Ralph Bellamy (as George Fleetwood) is also interested in Hepburn  but for different reasons; Mr. Bellamy wants to know more about Jesus Christ  whom Hepburn worships.  After Hepburn employs the power of prayer to heal a child  neighborhood folks suspect she is a witch.  If it weren't so serious  Spitfire might be more amusing; it is an atypical and wildly inappropriate vehicle for its star  who is thoroughly unconvincing. Of the leads  Mr. Bellamy performs best. However  the best characterization is essayed by Sarah Haden (as Etta Dawson)  who appeared in George Cukor's stage version  along with Louis Mason (as Bill Grayson). Will Geer (as West Fry)  Grandpa Walton in the 1970s  has a small role. An unexpected ending helps.\n",

      "Greeted with derision by most critics when it first appeared  'Frenzy' has recently done the rounds of UK TV. I remember seeing it on its original release  and thinking then that if Hitchcock wanted to parade some kind of screen confession about his ingrained misogynism  he couldn't have found a nastier little vehicle to do so.  But Time alters perspective  and so what was nauseatingly bad in 1972 might  all these years later  be worthy of upward re-evaluation.  Might. . . but not. 'Frenzy' is dross. The dross of an ageing director who desperately wanted to exploit the artistic freedom of 70s movie making without seeming to realise that freedom imposes its own obligations -- notably  the need to bring integrity to one's work.  There's none here. And not much evidence of the earlier directorial brilliance  either -- the switch from spine-tingling implicit to odious explicit is neither shocking nor  for a supreme stylist  stylish: it's just banal (the prolonged murder scene is precisely that: prolonged  without pace  without reason  without purpose other than the cheapest of directorial desires to appear as contemporary an artiste as  say  that other acclaimed practitioner of cheap sleaze  Michael Winner).  And it goes from bad to worse  with dialog that defies any human provenance (not least in the ludicrous diversion into the Home Life of Our Dear Wooden Inspector  and his wife's cooking).  Perhaps the scene that best sums up 'Frenzy' (and endures as the most explicit indictment of Hitchcock's persona) is the clunking exchange between two lawyers in a bar  where they discuss the serial killings and then agree that at least the women had a good time first by being raped.  I remember my revulsion at that scene back in '72  and it's still undimmed  because this wasn't Hitchcock being clever  or sardonic  or trying to make some universal point (big themes  big truths  were not Hitchcock's forte  nor personal preference.) It was just Hitchcock  allowing a reflection of his own distorted mirror on life to shine through the texture of the movie.  Calling 'Frenzy' Hitchcock's last great masterpiece is to betray little if any understanding of just what Hitchcock actually achieved in the way of cinematic trickery  cinematic thrills  and dazzling cinematic mastery.  'Frenzy' is therefore now what it always was: a cheap  nasty  and ham-fisted movie that did no service to any of those involved  or to the memory of a film-maker who really was  in his Hollywood days  one of the greatest there has ever been.\n",

      "The first thing you should know about Zipperface is that it was shot on video  so it has that peculiar home-video-ish look that is terribly distracting and makes it hard to take this seriously as a real film. And Zipperface indeed looks as if a bunch of amateurs got together for an attempt at a real serial-killer thriller. It's not quite that  but it's not as bad as it looks  either. Having a woman as one of the two detectives on the case puts a spin on the exploitation genre. Dona Adams gives an appealingly amateurish performance in the role - her obvious inexperience in front of the camera somehow works for her. Plus  she puts up a GREAT fight against the killer at the end. The red herrings appear ludicrous at first  but ultimately they work - I guessed the killer INcorrectly. And you have to wonder if perhaps Tarantino had seen the Zipperface guy when he came up with the idea of The Gimp for Pulp Fiction. (*1/2)\n",

      "The first half of this movie was quite good. It was interesting and suspenseful. The second half was pretty bad. The comic book revenge story came full circle and we see lots of comic Nazi characters and some badly acted good guys blowing them away. There's a lot of violence in this movie. I'm not squeamish about violence but I think it should at least have some purpose in a movie. There was little purpose to the violence here except to create a genre film where we see lots of people getting mowed down with rifles. We're somehow supposed to be amused by this.  I watched Reservoir Dogs recently. There was a movie where violence was employed effectively. It was realistic within the world the movie created. There were never any over-the-top sound effect. It was a crime movie which played it straight. Inglorious Basterds should have played it straight but didn't. I was rolling my eyes at how the violence was exaggerated with sound effects and extra bullets to the head and face.  None of the back-story of any of the Basterds is really explained either  they're simply Nazi hunters. We don't really get to like any of them either because they're too busy cutting scalps off and shooting people in the face. It's all about revenge and very little else.  There was 2 1/2 hours to work with here but few of the Basterds were really examined in depth. This seems like it was simply a revenge flick pure and simple. We saw that in Tarantino's last flick  Death Proof which I didn't care for either. It suffered the same problems. The characters were almost interchangeable.  The first half again  was pretty good. I wanted to see the exploits of the Inglorious Basterds across Europe. I was presented with a much lamer movie about the resistance movement plotting revenge against some comic book Nazis when they all go to one movie premiere in France.\n",

      "The Ealing Comedies constitute their own specific sub-genre in the history of film. They were wry  droll reflections on British life in the late Forties and early Fifties. They are always amusing but I feel it is misleading to characterise them as comedies. They are breezy and good-humoured  rather than laugh-out-loud funny. However  the best of them are laced with understated satire and shot through with an occasional dark streak (epecially Kind Hearts and Coronets and The Ladykillers).  I have an affection for all of them  but The Lavender Hill Mob is probably the one I have most difficulty with. Compared to the others  it seems somewhat perfunctory. To me  it is an outline sketch for a movie  but one that needed to spend a lot more time in development before it was ready to go before the cameras.  Everything about it is a bit undercooked. For example  nobody is given any real context or background. Henry is simply a dutiful drudge  whose secret dreams and hidden ambitions go unrecognised  while Albert is a frustrated artist forced to prostitute his talent by making gift shop trash for a living. This establishes a motive for their crime  but nothing that subsequently happens is a consequence either of their characters or their plan.  Other characters are introduced but play no real part in the story. The elderly resident in Henry's guest house could (with her love of detective stories) have been made an unwitting thorn in his side  but is merely used as background 'colour'. Similarly  the various policemen who pop in and out of the action are simply there to keep the plot ticking along.  As a result  the movie is driven entirely by its contrived plot devices  which I find both frustrating and faintly irritating. The not-very-ingenious robbery is accomplished with minimal problems  despite Albert being prevented from carrying out his part in the plan (by Sidney Tafler's Clayton). The gold is then smuggled to France without mishap. Everything would have gone smoothly if it wasn't for a minor hitch  lamely based on the French pronunciation of the letter 'R'  which results in six of the gold Eiffel Towers being accidentally sold to some English schoolgirls.  This leads to a series of frantic chases as Henry and Albert seek to retrieve them. These scenes are well executed  but at each point the conspirators are frustrated in their pursuit of the schoolgirls by a series of wholly factitious accidents. It is as if God is deliberately intervening to give them a hard time. This kind of plotting always has me grinding my teeth.  When they finally track the last Eiffel Tower to a Police Academy exhibition and snatch it from under the nose of John Gregson's Police Inspector (why is he there  anyway?) all shreds of plot logic are abandoned. The final car chases are then simply filling up screen time until we are returned to the framing device with which the picture began.  The movie doesn't even bother to tell us the fate of Albert (Stanley Holloway)  Lackery (Sid James) and Shorty (Alfie Bass).  This genial little caper has the professionalism of the Ealing team behind it  so it is far from being a bad movie. I suspect most viewers will find it considerably more enjoyable than I do (and why shouldn't they?)  but I cannot help thinking there was a much better movie waiting to be made  if only more time and effort had been expended on fleshing out both the characters and the story.  By the standards established by Ealing  Lavender Hill Mob is a missed opportunity.  PS: One curious footnote is that Audrey Hepburn gets a credit for her single line early on  but Archie Duncan remains anonymous despite his much more substantial contribution. I guess she just had a better agent.\n",

I actually laughed out loud in many parts of this movie because the next scene was so predictable and just plain stupid. As one scene moved on to the next  I often found myself wondering just how we got there  like I had skipped a few chapters in a book.  The script was pretty pitiful and didn't have me or my wife caring much about any of the characters  except the jilted boyfriend. Now  if the ex boyfriend had gotten an axe  and hacked apart the girl and rich kid  then.... then we would have a movie  and all the stupid dialog and leaps in plot could be acceptable.

      "Jean Claude Van Damme's movie career seems to have gone to hell in a handcart so how ironic to see him playing a character who meets the same fate in a literal manner at the very start of the movie ! It's also interesting to note how very   very similar the plots of his movies play out regardless of who the producer   director or screenwriter are . Van Damme usually plays a character who is living in France then due to a set of circumstances finds himself in another part of the globe where he has a brother who dies and it's up to Van Damme to get revenge helped by a character he's just met . Look at AWOL or LEGOINAIRRE or many other films that feature the headline  Starring Jean Claude Van Damme  and they all feature nearly the same type of story structure . This doesn't mean they're identical of course   just very similar and if you've seen one Van Damme movie you've basically seen them all . It's the same with MAXIMUM RISK\n",

      "This is an awful movie from just about every point of view. Since much has been already pointed out in previous reviews  let me just focus on Serbs and Delta Force guys in this movie.  1) The uniforms that Serbs wear are not Serbian. And helmets are wrong  too.  2) The actors who play Serbs are not speaking Serbian  not even a language close to Serbian  unlike in Behind enemy lines where the Czech actors did their best to speak the language and add at least a bit of credibility to the movie.  3) The gray-bearded Serbian general looks and acts like a moron  firing his gun whenever US soldiers call his name:   - US soldier: Gravic! Give up!  - Gray-bearded moronic general: (fires his AK47)  - US soldier: Gravic! Come out!  - GBMG: (fires his AK47)  - US soldier: Gravic! You're surrounded  - GBMG: (fires his AK47)  - Prop guy: Excuse me  Mr. gray-bearded moronic general  see  we're out of blanks and I sent the boy to buy some more  but he's not back yet...  - GBMG: (click)  4) Since when does the Army issue AK47s to the Delta Force? I guess they couldn't find enough working M4s in Bulgaria  but there were plenty of old AK47s and practice blanks ;) Maybe they should have went for some airsofts  they are cheaper and wouldn't have hurt the credibility of the movie anyway...  5) In the scene where a DF officer is hanging on a rope while talking to a rocket scientist  he is holding his finger on the trigger all the time. No sane person with any weapons training or just plain common sense would ever do that. I guess the actor figured that his coolness level increases the longer he holds the gun that way.

There is a little humor in this short  but it's basically as pretentious as (and perhaps a collegiate answer to) BLOOD OF A POET and other avant garde films of the time.

      "I grew up watching the Bowery Boys on the weekends and even at young an age I could tell this was low rent stuff as the name implies. Still it was fun to watch Satch (Hall) get the better of Muggs (Gorcey) after Muggs would beat the crap out him. The East Side Kids stuff were never shown even though it was public domain stuff and probably cheap to run  it was just to low a standard for kids to tune in even though we only had like 5 channels to watch. Enter the year 2005 and I am repossesin about my childhood. I can't find any Bowery Boys on DVD but I found The East Side Kids on disc and also on a public domain website. Thankfully I saved my dough and saw Bowery Blitz on the web for free  and it really really blows. Now I can see there are some Bowery Boys and maybe Monogram bad movie lovers here that gave this melodrama crap a 7 of 10 but c'mon folks  this ain't even trying to be funny. It's an East Side Kids drama  not a comedy so it's no good. The best part was seeing Muggs fight at the end  he reminded me of my grade school days flayling away like a girl when I would get in a fight  it was kinda abusin. Leonard Maltin said in his mini bio that this flick is one of the better ones  so you can just imagine the rest. If you wanna see some halfway decent East Side action see Ghosts on The Loose maybe but the bottom line is usually a comedy team starts out strong in their career and tapers off  these mugs blew chucks early on then slowly picked it up until Hall's antics dominated than they were at best. Still 2nd tier stuff way below the 3 stooges  who they imitate but amusing for those who grew up with them. This feature won't bring back pleasant Bowery Boys memories and is best left to Monogram fanatics.\n",

      "Am I the only person who thinks that the entire Forensics and Scenes Of Crime community in the USA must detest this almighty slap in their faces. A rookie cop is first to a crime scene where her back up is so slow to respond that she has time to send the kid who found the body to the local store to buy a disposable camera. By the time he returns (still no senior cops  SOCOs or other assistance for the lovely Jolie - this is New York isn't it??) it has started raining and she gets to work photographing the evidence  only after she'd stood in front of an Amtrak to stop it disturbing the scene.  I want to know the name of that camera as the photographs were so incredibly detailed that no amount of zooming in distorted the images!! The horror continues:- not in the film itself (pretty ordinary I'm afraid) but in the Lincoln Rhyme character as played by Mr Washington. This man is a highly dedicated Forensic Crime Scene Examiner with years of experience who  instead of the highly trained but invisible local Crime Scene Examiners  entrusts the work to an untrained cop  a rookie cop  who proceeds to find the very obviously placed clues and move them before photographing them thus contaminating every item and making DNA profiling well nigh impossible. Now that was a bright idea eh? I know one should be able to suspend disbelief to a degree but those who say this film is intelligent must have entirely disengaged their ability to think in order to find this film believable.

      "A four-and-a-half-hour O'Neill play gets boiled down to a little under two  and much of that running time is devoted to actors with frozen expressions on their faces as they read their characters' thoughts in voice-over. It can work onstage  but it looks hilariously stilted in this soap-opera adaptation  which soft-peddles its heroine's bad behavior and never explains why she has so captivated so many men. Norma Shearer and Alexander Kirkland  overacting ludicrously  are outclassed by a naturalistic Clark Gable--he's the only one who makes the frozen-face technique work. It gets even funnier when Shearer's and Gable's son  a surly moppet  does the frozen-face shtick. There are also Frank Morgan's brother Ralph as an unsuccessful suitor  given to soliloquizing poor Charlie! over and over again  and a young Robert Young and Maureen O'Sullivan. By the time they show up  the voice-overs have largely been abandoned  and it plays as a ripe soap  with a sentimental fadeout that actually plays Silver Threads Among the Gold as background music. Robert Leonard's direction is stodgy and he shows little facility for reining in hyperactive actors. It's certainly entertaining--there's nothing else like it  unless you count Groucho's satirical parody in Animal Crackers  or an old Mad Magazine satire that rendered Shirley Booth's sitcom Hazel a la Strange Interlude.

      "Contains spoilers.   The British director J. Lee Thompson made some excellent films  notably 'Ice Cold in Alex' and 'Cape Fear'  but 'Country Dance' is one of his more curious offerings. The story is set among the upper classes of rural Scotland  and details the strange triangular relationship between Sir Charles Ferguson  an eccentric aristocratic landowner  his sister Hilary  and Hilary's estranged husband Douglas  who is hoping for a reconciliation with her. We learn that during his career as an Army officer  Charles was regarded as having 'low moral fibre'. This appears to have been an accurate diagnosis of his condition; throughout the film he displays an attitude of gloomy disillusionment with the world  and his main sources of emotional support seem to be Hilary and his whisky bottle. The film ends with his committal to an upper-class lunatic asylum.   Peter O'Toole was  when he was at his best as in 'Lawrence of Arabia'  one of Britain's leading actors  but the quality of his work was very uneven  and 'Country Dance' is not one of his better films. He overacts frantically  making Charles into a caricature of the useless inbred aristocrat  as though he were auditioning for a part in the Monty Python 'Upper-Class Twit of the Year' sketch. Susannah York as Hilary and Michael Craig as Douglas are rather better  but there is no really outstanding acting performance in the film. There is also little in the way of coherent plot  beyond the tale of Charles's inexorable downward slide.  The main problem with the film  however  is neither the acting nor the plot  but rather that of the Theme That Dare Not Speak Its Name. There are half-hearted hints of an incestuous relationship between Charles and Hilary  or at least of an incestuous attraction towards her on his part  and that his dislike of Douglas is motivated by sexual jealousy. Unfortunately  even in the swinging sixties and early seventies (the date of the film is variously given as either 1969 or 1970) there was a limit to what the British Board of Film Censors was willing to allow  and a film with an explicitly incestuous theme was definitely off-limits. (The American title for the film was 'Brotherly Love'  but this was not used in Britain; was it too suggestive for the liking of the BBFC?) These hints are therefore never developed and we never get to see what motivates Charles or what has caused his moral collapse  resulting in a hollow film with a hole at its centre. 4/10\n",

Oh  it's so je-ne-sais-quoi... Written/directed (or auteured) by a woman (Lisa Krueger  whoever the hell you are)  this is a pointless  lethargically directed road-movie full of New Age spiritualistic nonsense and characters that are meant to be interesting but are merely seen-before or just plain dull. The Latinos in this movie  as part of the poor urban minority  are typically glorified in all their mysticism-obsessed primitivism as a spiritually superior people  which is the highlight of this film's political correctness.  The whole affair is lifeless  and ceases to be so only when occasional good cast members appear (Kay Place  Baker  Wilson). On the other hand we have Casey Affleck  who is one of the very best examples of why nepotism is on par with first-degree murder as a crime. I have rarely seen a more apathetic actor; a skinny  ugly moron who goes through his lines in a sleepy manner  almost as if he were uttering them in a half-awake quasi-dream  plus that weak voice  one of the weakest male voices I've heard in my life.

      "Being a fan of ZaSu Pitts comedies  I thought this one looked like it was worth a try. I was quite disappointed.  (The version I saw was on TCM  but consisted only of the Niagara Falls movie; the Miss Polly movie was absent.) The talents of the actors  who give fine performances  is wasted on one of the stupidest stories I have ever had the misfortune of sitting through.  Tom Brown (Tom Wilson) surprised me by being the strongest actor in the show  but the spotlight is hogged by Slim Summerville (Sam Sawyer)  who  if he has any talent  didn't demonstrate it here.  ZaSu Pitts (Elly Sawyer) is great  but doesn't have near big enough a part. The biggest laugh in the movie is when she ends up under Sam under a table.  The only one in the movie who has any sense at all is Tom Wilson. Margie (Marjorie Woodworth) is unreasonable in general. While she is physically quite attractive  her personality and attitudes make her completely undesirable. Elly  Sam  and the hotel desk clerk are just complete fools.  Sam and Elly give up their honeymoon suite in the crowded hotel for Tom and Margie. But then they take it back. Sam ends up imprisoning Tom and Margie in their room. Most of the movie is them trying to break out  but Sam  using a rifle  always puts them back again.  Towards the end comes the worst part. Tom  who is finally about to make good his escape  runs into a minister on a lower floor of the hotel. Now the guy  who  as I said  is the only one in the whole movie who has a head on his shoulders  suddenly  for absolutely no reason at all  decides he has to marry Margie!  He drags the minister up to the room he has just escaped from  but Margie doesn't want to marry him. He gives her a kiss  and now  after one kiss  she feels compelled to marry him.  Finally  Sam has the nerve to say to Tom  You deceived me  when practically the only line Tom had to Sam earlier was  We're not married  to which Sam replied  You think I'd believe that?

      "Post 1988 after the disaster GJS Amitabh's films lost the quality they had earlier   Barring MAIN AZAAD HOON released in 1989 which was a great film rest all films were craps mostly except HUM(1991) later in 1991  This is another of the crap Amitabh films people rejected in early 90's  The film he did like a friendship token to Shashi Kapoor who directed the film and he didn't take a penny The film also had Rishi and Dimple(again not paired opp each other after RANBHOOMI)   The film came in 1991 when Bachchan had 4 releases and 3 flops amongst them INDRAJEET  AKAYLA  AJOOBA   Ajooba came 2 years after TOOFAN and JAADUGAR both supernatural films which were rejected This is another type of crap Bachchan wears a mask and a Krissh type outfit and performs magic changing 1 person to a donkey.etc Of course being 1991 you can excuse the special effects but the film is too bad to be watched  Direction by Shashi Kapoor is not good Music is bad  Amongst actors Amitabh had become too old by 1991 and looked tired  his acting is okay but not on par with his best Rishi is okay Dimple is alright  rest are forgettable\n",

      "I liked the first The Grudge. It really creeped me out and it had something to it that made me want to see it twice. That something was missing from this sequel. There was no creativity  nothing new or original  nothing that really sticks to your mind. It's people dying because a scary ghost comes out of the shadows and says boo. And most of the time  it wasn't even all that scary.  Plot-wise this movie is a dead end. Amber Tamblyn is a good actress  but she was given nothing to do  and Karen's death seemed really unsatisfactory because it came so quickly. I was also disappointed in the Kayako's mother subplot. I was thinking that she might provide some way to fight the Grudge  but she dies in the hands - hair? - of Kayako. That was such a stupid twist. All in all  it's difficult to feel for characters that you know from minute one are going to die. All in the same way. And there's nothing they can do. It doesn't feel like a cruel destiny awaiting them. It's just boring  because you know what's going to happen. If they had anything to fight it with  that would have added suspense  even if they failed. If there was any hope  it would make the scares more justified. Now you're just waiting for them to die.  Kayako was really scary in the first movie  but this time we saw her too many times and that took away some of it. I was still scared during some scenes  but I actually got used to the huge eye and blue face. The makers obviously realized this would happen as they added other scary ghosts. Yes  I was scared at the school psychologist scene - even if I knew where it was going as soon as she said I've been to the house. A nice touch. Toshio  however  was not scary at all in this movie. I was much more creeped out by the non-blue Toshio with black eyes and a blank stare that sometimes appeared in the first movie. A blue boy sitting in the corner does nothing for me.  Some of the characters seemed really unnecessary - the notorious milk-scene with the girl whose name I can't even remember comes to mind. I wasn't scared  it was just Huh? I'm not sure if the schoolgirls were even really needed. Karen could have brought the grudge to the US with her. It could have killed people related to her life  everyone at the funeral  or something like that. Even so  it would have been dull to watch them all die  but being introduced to so many unrelated people really felt annoying. Hated the I won't call you mother scene. Aubrey's mother issues were equally dull. The little boy was a touching character  though.  The Ju-On sequel was much scarier than this one. It had some new twists - dreams and reality blurring much more  for instance - and even if it left me feeling quite down  I was also somehow satisfied. I got to think a bit and be left wondering. This movie only provided cheap scares.\n",

      "More of a character study then a movie  COMMITTED is yet just another relationship romp with the trimmings specifically made for a young  target audience. The direction seems very basic  with obvious dramatic irony and a classic case of the lost loser versus the clueless committed. COMMITTED is watchable at times and there is a small feeling of originality from Lisa Krueger.  COMMITTED is completely aimless for the first twenty minutes. We get to know Joline but the movie picks up when her husband disappears. Joline sets off to find him.  Some parts are strange. Other times the movie drags. The second half is more humorous as we see Joline's spiritual antics take a turn for the more intense. The annoying guitar music is awful  but perhaps a necessary evil as COMMITTED offers very little anyway. An average movie hampered by some completely pointless moments  COMMITTED 's only asset is Heather Graham and Patricia Velazquez.\n",

      "This could have been great. The voice-overs are exactly right and fit the characters to a T. One small problem though; the look of the characters  mostly the supporting or guest characters look exactly the same. The same bored look on every face only with minor changes such as hairlines or weight size. It looks kind of odd to see a really big guest star's voice coming out of a lifeless form like the characters here. If I am not mistaken Kathy Griffin did a voice-over for this show and it looked too odd to be funny.  There is a few other problems  one being the family plot. The Simpsons did it much better where you could actually buy most of the situations the characters got themselves into. Here we get too much annoying diversions  like someone having a weird fantasy and then we are supposed to find that funny but for some reason the delivery is a bit off. As you can probably tell it is hard for me to put a finger on exactly what is wrong with this show because it basically nothing more than a clone of the Simpsons or even more Married with Children.  If I should point a finger on what is totally wrong with this it probably is it's repetitiveness. Peter Griffin is not really a bright character but neither are any of the others. Lois should have been named Lois Lame because she is sort of one-dimensional. Seth Green as the kind of retarded son is the best thing about this show and that is the most stereotypical part on the show.  So what more can I say. There isn't exactly anything wrong with this show but in the long run you have to admit that it takes a lot of work to do what the Simpsons has done for almost two decades.\n",

I told her that if the daughter and her father would not do these movie  they would have instead to go around and kill and cut people in pieces.  After every Lnych movie I tell myself  again one and a half hour lost of my life. But next time I will check the director's or producers name.  So  you don't want to be angry at yourself and loose time  don't watch it. But if you think that you need to kill someone  watch it  this is probably a better medicine than to spend your whole life in a prison for mentally insane.\n",

      "If I were to rate this movie based solely on the acting/script/production  etc.  I would give it one star. All these elements are awful. I can partially forgive this  in light of the film's $250 budget. The movie does contain many entertaining scenes  mostly those of the unintentionally funny variety. Some of these include: a 14-year-old kid stealing and driving a bus  teenage hooligans (one of whom is sporting a Joy Division t-shirt) getting scared away from harassing the film's protagonists by a woman brandishing an obviously fake firearm  and an encounter with a plastic bull's skull in the Arizona desert.  I would have given it 5 stars just for the entertainment value were it not for the presence of that horribly annoying  morally pontificating old granny. I had to dock one star just because of her.

      "CANNIBAL FEROX (1+ outta 5 stars) Miserable excuse for a movie... which you might enjoy if you really like boring  nonsensical jungle movies spiced up with scenes of graphic violence. A pair of drug dealers on the run from the mob travel to the jungles of Paraguay to search for emeralds and cocaine. They meet up with another young traveler and his two hot babe sidekicks  one of whom is an anthropologist seeking to prove definitively that cannibalism does not and has not ever existed. One of the two dealers turns out to be a bit of a psychopath and he tortures and kills a couple of natives in order to get them to tell him where they hide their jewels. (And how they could even tell him when he doesn't seem to speak their language in the first place?) Well  the natives are suddenly not too thrilled with white folks in their jungle and capture them all for some retaliatory torture. Poor acting  poor plot and poor direction. Not a decent moment of suspense in the whole dreary 90 minutes. Even the special effects are not particularly convincing (though a couple of shots will still make most viewers cringe). The only good scene in the whole movie is when the two women are imprisoned in a mud hut and seem to touch the hearts of the natives with their rendition of Red River Valley. The following is a quote from the movie but I wouldn't be surprised if many viewers weren't saying exactly the same thing by that point: Oh God  please let her die soon. Oh  let her die soon. And let me die soon too  please.\n",

      "I could tell this would be a bad one from the trailer  but the lure of the DVD box got me to rent it anyway. Boy was I right..  Also for some reason the DVD version is VERY fuzzy and unclear at times (in terms of video quality). It appears as if they shot the whole movie with a 20 year old camcorder  it looks so bad. I really did not like the plot  and after watching the movie I was very let down. I will NOT tell any spoilers  but let it be said that the end was so bad that I laughed  it has been done so many times before.  The whole story seems like something that came out of a middle schooler's English paper. If I had to peg one movie as the worst horror movie I've ever seen  this one may just be it. I can't believe they actually released this film. It really isn't worth the rent  or a penny of anyone's money unless you want a good laugh at the movie's expense.\n"
